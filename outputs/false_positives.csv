there was a great film to be made about steve biko  sadly this wasn t it  denzel washington   not_the most flexible of actors   is totally unable to convey the great charisma that biko had  attenborough s big crowd scenes are laughable  the soweto massacre wasn t like this  three neat lines of children   some doing cartwheels   marching happily into the guns of the soldiers  with biko dead the film rapidly descends into farce  if the struggle against apartheid was anything it was a black people s struggle yet somehow we are all supposed to be gripped by the escape of a white man and his family  i m sure donald woods was a decent man and he would be the first to say that biko was important while he wasn t  penelope wilton s accent is pure hampshire and she seems completely unaware that she is in south africa at all  at all  the wood s family dog gets more lines than the black maid  as the family make their escape one the women i saw the film with   incidentally one of only about a dozen black people in a large  full cinema   whispered  this is like the sound of music   she had a point overall this is a film by a well intentioned if somewhat inept white liberal about a radical black people s struggle  and really south africa needs well intentioned white liberals like it needs a hole in the head,0,1,0.4397711760822784
just cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out   nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from ed harris  then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until you ve got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet sean connery s wife  a typically mannered and unconvincing kate capshaw  and kid  a very young scarlet johannsen  in an alligator skinner s shack  the kind of movie that s probably best seen on a plane  and even then only once,0,1,0.6166604568130529

it s hard to believe  after waiting 14 years  we wind up with this piece of cinematic garbage  the original was a high impact  dark thriller that achieved  cult  status demonstrating the fine art of cinema as directed by paul verhoeven  this film adds nothing  delivers nothing  and ultimately winds up in the big box of failed sequels the opening sequence could have triggered an intriguing set of plot developments using a considerably talented and able cast  unfortunately we are treated to a 90 minute dissertation in the self indulgent life of catherine tramell    or is it sharon stone  possibly a copulation of both if the desire is too see a continuation of the sensually provocative stying of sex as in  b s 1   forget it  you wind up with soft porn boredom which ultimately upholds the old adage that a woman can be more alluring in clothes than out of them  it s interesting to note that the wonderful charlotte rampling was romping around in her skivvies  via the 1966 georgy girl  when ms  stone was only 8 years old  a very talented actress and quite adept at holding her own even here if you re a true cinema fan then you must see this film and judge it using your own rating system  if not_you might as well wait for the dvd release in the  rated  version   unrated  version   collectors  edition  or  ultimate  version  and perhaps in another 14 years we will be saturated with news of  basic instinct 3  at which point ms  stone will be 62 years old and nobody will really care,0,1,0.5726013473263736
wow it s ironic since this movie has been out for awhile i think that someone else just reviewed it a couple days ago anyways  i watched this movie simply because it has nick stahl  for the record the movie was ridiculous  the characters drove me insane  they were so cliché and stereotyped  this movie had some of the worst dialogue i have ever heard  it had way too many plot twists too there is one scene in the movie worth seeing however  the scene   warm heart  cold gun  where nick stahl kills the obnoxious girl in the shower   well  actually they were all obnoxious   but his acting in that scene was excellent  the look on his face  it reminded my of american psycho  a good movie   the scene is worth seeing but not_worth seeing the rest of the movie for  do yourself a favor and don t watch it,0,1,0.3768990542800495
it s pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the palestinian girl and her family  the film and it s website tries to imply that ayat has a secret reason for blowing herself and rachel up  a boyfriend problem  perhaps pregnancy  neatly glossed over is the fact that ayat had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the israelis  just outside her home  gosh so why on earth would a young  pretty  intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing  could it be that the hormonal  emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very eyes  this detail merits all of 5 seconds in the movie  another neatly sidestepped detail is that avigail levy  rachels  mother  could have prevented the destruction of the building the akhras family lived in along with 22 other families   one distinctly gets the impression that she s offering this as a  concession    should mrs  akhras agree to speak with her  why should i   she says  since the movie was made the home has been destroyed  apparently the interview didn t result in what she wanted  so bring on the bulldozers mrs levy claimed that she  wanted the movie to be cathartic as well as a symbol of hope  a chance to transcend entrenched hatreds   instead she uses it as an excuse to harangue ayats mother  while dangling the house as a carrot moreover although the two women live only 4 miles apart  she is so out of touch with the realities of the occupation for her palestinian neighbors  that she really thinks that mrs  akhras can just drop over for a cup of coffee please and she forgoes the one chance she had to meet mrs  akhras in person and see what kind of life she lives  the akras family originally came from jaffa  but now live crammed into a refugee camp only 4 miles from where the levys live in comparative luxury any sympathy i would have had for the obviously well to do mrs  levy is dissolved by her air of self righteous bitchiness by contrast  ayats mother comes off as kind forthright and loving  in spite of the best efforts by the post production crew to paint her and her family as monsters  heck even the music and sound design was one sided  i guess the muezzin sings all day every day 4 miles from the levy family home  always in a sharply contrasting key from the sappy new age music that scores this drab excuse for a documentary also there is the small matter of translations   mrs  levy directly addresses the camera in english when she has something worked out to say ahead of time  hebrew when she doesn t  mrs akhras spoke only arabic which received sometimes a translation  sometimes transliteration  always awkward  and very suspect for a supposedly objective movie they also  sweated  her under the lights  while mrs  levy sat in  air conditioned  comfort rotten editing for mrs  akhras  segments too  i gave it a 2 because i liked ayats mother and father  who seemed like good decent people  shame on hbo  producers and director  for releasing such a stink bomb,0,1,0.4088984251391498

contrary to another reviewer  i think that this is well written  especially the more fictional it is  because greater imagination would be required  and well acted  because there were not_other characters with whom to share the focus of these dozen minutes plus  well done monologues  but i m just not_entertained by such solemn  pious rememberances  everybody has a story to tell and some are more interesting than others  everybody has problems and some are more intense than others  these are just ten  not_very atypical stories and problems  exemplifying how anybody s life  or part of it  is fodder for film  then again  i think poorly of tv s reality shows  too  so  if that s your bag  you may like this  it s the kind of stuff that would make for good  phone and or internet gossip  but absolutely without other than verbal action  and  although each of the speakers is female  i m gonna leave gender outta this,0,1,0.5060255299696408
i love the music of the clash and i love the music of joe strummer and the mescaleros  i went to this movie hoping to learn about the man behind most of that  but i came out of the theatre not_knowing much more about joe than i already did after reading the entry on wikipedia  the movie not_gets through to the person  his thoughts and feelings  what they did was to collect the little material that they had  shaky blurry videos and to interview some people about joe strummer at a camp fire  it turns out that most of these people knew him very little or not_at all  and that the director just wanted them in the movie in order to have some more celebrities say   oh  he was such an inspiration to all of us   like bono or johnny depp  whom they seemingly asked to keep his pirate costume on to benefit from his current success in pirates of the caribbean   it seems that the director could not_even wait until the body was cold before he jumped in to sell his version of  the greatest punk rocker and hippie at heart  that ever lived  sanctifying the person without really knowing enough about him sure  being a fan i enjoyed seeing the images of the band  hearing the anecdotes behind the songs and such  but in the end i felt like what remained as the portrait of joe strummer could have easily been told in 60 90 minutes go see the movie if you are a fan  otherwise better listen to some music of the clash or even better the undeservedly unknown mescaleros  where joe strummer reached the peak of his musical development before his death  melting all his rich influences together to one amazing sound,0,1,0.5181386150214333

in the days before gore and sex took over  real horror films were made  castle of blood is  in my estimation  one of the finest  although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings  in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others  which was in the theaters a couple of years ago director antonio margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time web of the spider  aka nella stretta morsa del ragno   why he did this i do not_understand  although the remake starred anthony franciosa and klaus kinski and was very good in its own right  perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to american audiences  i do not_know  it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color castle of blood is excellent italian gothic  la danza macabra is said to be an unpublished work of edgar allen poe  who  appears  in this film  poe and lord blackwood  owner of a haunted castle  bet american writer alan foster  george riviere  that he cannot spend all souls night in said castle and survive  foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it  for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts  it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re enact the crimes they committed in life  lord blackwood conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next all souls night  it does not_take foster and the beautiful elisabeth blackwood  portrayed by the incomparable barbara steele  long to fall in love  even though their romance is doomed  because elisabeth is one of the ghosts  i will not_give the ending away  but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story  comments  this film is greatly atmospheric  even by the excellent standards of the italians  my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody  and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this  in fairness  web of the spider was fine in its own right  even with color and greater brightness  i loved the lingering shots  something most modern day directors do not_have the patience for  indeed  when alan first enters the doomed castle  we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room  the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms  by the time the first ghost appears  the audience is thoroughly primed and ready  there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts  something else not_often done in standard ghost stories  there are also memorable scenes  very visual for this type of film  elisabeth s  murder  and the dance scene  reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962 s carnival of souls  were particularly good sadly  few general interest viewers will ever hear of  much less see  this film  that is a shame  for this one is a cut above the rest  i got my copy from sinister cinema and am not_certain if it can be purchased anywhere else  for persons interested in this genre  it is a must see,0,1,0.8804726855000504

not_made a western  his vision would have been perfect black candles is easily his most notorious film and probably his best known after the masterpiece vampyres  and it s notoriety revolves around one scene where a satanic coven enacts a bizarre rite involving extracting the reproductive fluid of a goat    symbolizing the beast    as some kind of nauseating balm to be used in preparing the waif like sister of a murdered man for her role as the bride of satan  the scene in question is staged in a way that looks rather convincing even without the display of any plumbing apparatus the goat may have been endowed with  relying upon the histrionics of the actress recruited to play the supplicant in the ritual and lots of guttural chanting on the film s recycled musical score heard in a half dozen films attributed to jacinto molina  the perverse nature of the scene is more implied than shown in graphic detail  heightened somewhat by the knowledge that said supplicant is actually the teen aged daughter of the satanic priest  my but they had fun concocting this movie the problem with it is that there isn t much to deconstruct or contemplate aside from the paper thin rosemary s baby derived story of a woman being weaned into her role as satan s bride by a sophisticated coven of satanists living in the hedgrowed outlands of a very sinister britain  led by eurohorror sensation helga line these satanists are comprised of doctors  lawyers  land owning magnates and other upper crust dignitaries who actually owe their professional success to their worship of the devil  all you have to do is sell your soul and the world can be yours  only watch out whom you may sell out to pay back petty personal conflict or you may end up being felched with a sword the film attempts to combine this heady satanic trip with oodles or borderline graphic sex  and should correctly be regarded as a kind of apex or culmination of the sex and horror spanish thriller traditions popularized in part by mr  molina   ms  line  and which had amazingly flourished under the disapproving eye of one generalissimo franco  the dictator who controlled spain up until 1976  while he lived his decree was that spanish cinema was to be free of graphic depictions of on screen sex  spanish directors often made two versions of their films  one with the sex concealed for their own screens and one with the fornication on display for export  as difficult as it was for the filmmakers to express themselves the result was a sort of interesting tension that usually results when artists flirt with the forbidden  spanish horror from the 1970s has a very special flavor to it that is somewhat of an acquired taste  it s not_for everyone but in a bizarre turn of events  without franco s influence on their culture spanish horror sort of dried up in the late 1970s  when their gothic castles and demonic orgies suddenly found themselves passé when compared to new sensations like jaws and the star wars phenomenon  and without franco s constraints their were suddenly a flood of overtly graphic thrillers that came tumbling out of the pipes in the very late 70s early 80s  of which black candles is perhaps the best known due to it s emphasis on sexual deviancy with a barnyard animal  larraz  major horror films have always revolved around sexual taboos  the lesbianism of vampyres  the incest of scream and die   deviation  but here the effect of the depravity is to overshadow the rest of the production  nobody cares about anything else but the traditionally censored trip to the goat barn  and watching a cut version without the scene in the barn is almost an exercise in pointlessness  the sex isn t graphic enough to rate as porn and the chills aren t chilling enough to rate as horror so  black candles is essentially a behavior study    here is how high society british satanists might behave in their secluded mansions out in the west midlands or whatever  between sex scenes the actors actresses sit around and have lots of discussions  the best thing the film has going for it is an undeniably oppressive atmosphere of claustrophobia  with most of it s action taking place in the tightly confined interiors of ms  line s character s mansion  nearly every avenue of fornication is hinted at so fans of soft core sex romps with a hinting of supernatural horror will be amused  and of course the vicarious sex criminals amongst us will enjoy choking their chickens to the goat barn scene  but the ultimate conclusion of the film is silly  pretentious  intelligence insulting  and probably perfect for such an otherwise forgettable exercise in applied sleaze 2 10  without the goat barn this movie just isn t the same  and with the scene it s probably a bit too much for most viewers  larraz was correct to disown it,0,1,0.40243604219319146
why do movie makers always go against the author s work  i mean  yes  things have to be condensed for the sake of viewer interest  but look at anne of green gables  they did a wonderful job of combining important events into a cohesive whole that was simply delightful  i can t believe that they chose to combine three novels together for anne of avonlea into such a dreadful mess  look at all they missed out on by doing that       paul irving  little elizabeth  the widows  windy poplars       and anne s college years  for heaven s sake    wouldn t it have been delightful to meet priscilla and all the rest of the redmond gang  kevin sullivan should have taken things one movie at a time  instead of jumbling them all together and combining characters and events the way he did  this movie was good  if you leave the novels out of it   but l m  montgomery s beautiful work is something that should not_be denied  this movie was a let down after seeing the successful way he brough anne of green gables to life,0,1,0.5743021134574199

this was a less than exciting short film i saw between features on turner classic movies recently  while the film popped out due to its very intense technicolor  the film itself just wasn t that moving and at times the plot looked pretty cheesy  like this was made for classroom use and capturing the attention of a wider audience wasn t even a consideration  in particular  i really hated how many times in the film things were reiterated  such as when the characters talked to her  they usually said  clara barton  instead of  ma am    miss barton  or  clara   plus  one sickly confederate soldier said that he was a  johnny reb  a confederate a rebel       almost like he was the cartoon character mojo jojo from the powerpuff girls  this was just sloppy writing  period it was interesting to see john hamilton  later   perry white  on the superman tv show  in a beard as president garfield  yep  it s him under that beard,0,1,0.3952584522455576
funny that i find myself forced to review this movie  but here i am i am reviewing it  because just recently  i have had the chance to witness the revival of r c  sheriff s play  journey s end  on stage in new york  at the belasco theatre  starring hugh darcy  boyd gaines  jefferson mays and others  as well as being masterfully directed by david grindley i left the theater shattered  i am not_exaggerating  i was flabbergasted  after almost two and a half hours of a recreated and very claustrophobic depiction of soldier s life in the trenches of the somme  i speculate   during world war one  brought to life vividly  by everyone involved  i came out of the theater with the shakes mind you  i am not_shocked  nor am i too sensitive  i am a stage actor and a director myself  so i know the buttons being pressed to achieve certain effects  both emotionally  as well as psychologically but what i had just witnessed  came so much to life  that i had chills in my spine as i left none of these emotions came to life  while watching  aces high   the movie based on this play and even adapted for the screen  in cooperation with r c  sheriff himself  shortly before he died the screen adaptation takes place in the skies over france  so  gone is the claustrophobic ambiance to start with the only plus of the movie  are the aerial battle scenes  which look dated in their special effects  compared to today s standards  but still very valid in the flying tactics adopted on screen granted there had been a couple of screen adaptations of  all quiet on the western front  by erich maria remarque  which takes place in trenches  and not_in the sky  but that was the  german  vision on things  if one would like to be picky on such things  journey s end  is just the other side of the medal  and would have made it into a great movie  if they had left it alone and intact the transfer on dvd is poor  even though in widescreen and adapted for 16 9 tv screens  the quality of the film itself is that of a movie theater  nothing more  nothing less  it sports various defects  such as minor scratches and dots  although the copy  for the rest  is clean if you want another wwi movie in your collection  especially for those who love and enjoy to see aerial battles among old timers  then this is a picture for you  but i rather would suggest  von richthofen and brown  as an alternative  although that too  is a movie filled with inaccuracies for the rest of you  who love good acting and drama  i would leave this one out  buy the play  go watch the play  if you have the chance to get a decent revival of it near you  but keep off this would be adaptation it is an anti war movie  granted  but the weakest i have ever seen in my lifetime ever the presence of actors such as trevor howard  ray milland  richard johnson and john gielgud  is just a bluff  since they are just seen in very weak and very brief cameo roles throughout the movie mcdowell  the very talented christopher plummer  simon ward and peter firth  all deliver very weak performances  not_due to their lack of skills  but rather due to lack of true and solid direction there are too many gaps in it  and as said before  it drags itself to the dubious end  dubious because in the original play  none of the men we come to know and sympathize with  stay alive  they are all killed in a fatal and futile mission  in the movie they all die  except malcolm mcdowell  who manages somehow to stay alive another day  being the wing commander of the unlucky bunch  just to receive another three pilots to fly and die for another lost cause the end of the play leaves a bare stage in total darkness  you just hear the cannons roar  the machine guns rattle  and grenade impacts throughout the theater  then  suddenly  total peace and silence  the curtain comes up  lights  and here they all are  lined up  standing straight and rigid  obedient corpses   far more interesting and far more shocking than  aces high  finale  which is also dragged by the hair it is up to you to judge for me  if i had the money and the contacts to do so  i would take the play and develop it  the way it was meant  adding here and there some action scene in the field  just to visualize the  outer  horror and slaughter going on in the  vasty fields of france   around the men involved  but then  just strictly concentrating on what is going on  in that tiny  shack  at the edge of sanity and the world   want such a movie then ask for it this is not_it,0,1,0.5222265863686523

this movie is like the material s e  hinton was writing in the 1970s and copola was adapting to the screen in the early 80s  and  had trueblood actually been a product of either  the results might ve been much better  especially in the acting department   instead  we get a rather so bad its funny piece of mediocrity jeff fahey plays ray trueblood  a former street rumbler  i suppose is the accurate description  this was in the days of action movies that used guys in their 40s and mid30s and dressed them up in greaser threads or some kind of more effeminate selection of gang garb and they fought to lousy 80s music  nonetheless  ray is the lone caretaker of his younger brother  donny  chad lowe in a part where he screams a lot   who he is forced to leave behind inexplicably in a train station when  on the run from the cops  he is nabbed and forced to serve time in the marines  flash forward to present day and ray is back in town and looking for his brother who has also become part of the street gangs  although in a gang that was ray s adversary and now old scores must be violently settled  and again  cops must be dodged and this time  a lady s honor defended in the action film sense  before ray can carry on life at normal pace with his brother  donny for the most part  the film is quite ridiculous  for me  most of this has to do with far too much overacting  although not_by fahey or sherlyn fenn who plays the waitress he befriends  the guys in the gang and lowe himself seem to do quite a bit of needless exaggerated as new york street toughs  although  the bigger hang up is recycled plot lines and perhaps a kind of movie that was well past its prime as a product of 1989,0,1,0.377220083384655

when i sat down to watch this film i actually expected quite a bit  as the plot takes on quite complex issues  using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach  still unfortunately  despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between muslim and western culture  adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gays lesbians  it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film  this leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle  attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal with however  this does not_mean that the film is directly bad  as it s rendering of the conflicts where quite believable and also amusing  the film succeeds in being engaging and entertaining in this matter  but as mentioned above the writers seem to have spun themselves a little too deep  this has led to some quite unrealistic character behaviour towards the end to confront the surging conflicts  by this dropping the ball at a time where the makers could really have shown brilliance taking the film to another level of appreciation even if the film does at not_point really attempt to be a profound piece of drama  the setting has so much potential in the plot it becomes a disappointment when  the ball drops   this way the film moves from being a good and reflected comedy to a standard cliché that becomes ridiculous in its happy ending  nothing is left out in the hollywood like ending  so even if the story is engaging and one can stomach the large amount of montages  one can t help but roll eyes towards the resolution  personally i was close to shouting  finish already    at the screen there were some decent acting in the film  and the two young female central characters had some good moments  so did their parents and other bi characters  however the handsome irish coach was an embarrassing piece of acting  that lets the film down quite a bit in terms of realism  he didn t even appear very likable  but rather self involved despite his good deeds  which makes the impending conflict between the girls seem a little strained i give the film a 4  as it was an engaging story and they sought out a nice perspective to approach the subject from  the script and cast had many good believable characters  giving the audience a chance to recognise either themselves or others  had the let downs not_been this disappointing  i d easily give the film a 7 or 8  if you enjoyed this film  i d recommend the film  east is east   which i think is an as good  if not_better rendering of cultural conflict  as well as being amusing and engaging,0,1,0.5047315292843342

using tons of stock footage  not_from trader horn but also the first two films in the series  for example the alligator fight was used last time out  this is one of the weakest films in the mgm series  its a huge let down after the classic tarzan and his mate which is possibly the best film in the series the plot has jane s cousins coming into the jungle to tell her that she has inherited a fortune if she ll come back to claim it  they are kind of in the bind since the relative that left her the money cut them out of the will hiring a great white hunter  who secretly wishes to capture tarzan and sell him  the pair heads into the jungle where they run into the usual jungle troubles  more so because of the stock footage   after lots of talk jane decides to go back to civilization and we get long sequences of tarzan and jame making kissy face  finally into the last half hour the plot to capture tarzan is put in motion and things at last become interesting as plans go awry and things look very grim for all concerned  painfully dull film is clear evidence of a troubled production  the film seems to have been assembled from several different films with the first half hour playing as an almost exact repeats of the previous film  the middle third shows signs of having to stretch things out and having plot lines that ultimately went nowhere  the last third where tarzan is captured and the party is put into peril is the point that the film finally comes to life  it also shows signs of the graphic violence that caused much of the need to re shoot the film   to me its a great wonder how the series managed to continue on from here since this film isn t very good  except at the end  i would be hard pressed to explain it except i would have to say that it was the relationship between weissmuller and o sullivan as tarzan and jane which kept people coming back  its a beautifully acted pairing and really is one of the screens great couples  i should probably also mention that this is the point that the film became less real and more fantastical with the appearance of the tarzan tree house   i really dislike the first hour or so of this film a great deal and find it a great waste of time and energy  if you can come in towards the end i would recommend giving the film a try  otherwise i would just skip the whole film and move on to the next film in the series,0,1,0.6091637851894696
just too many incidents of violence the film goes from one scene to another  and in nearly every one violence erupts now i am not_one who is shocked by violence  and to me a film without a fight in it has something missing  but  please  not_one after another  my reaction was not_shock or horror  it was   here we go again   there is some semblance of a story in between the scenes of violence  but two thirds of the way through the film i had switched off completely  and couldn t wait for the end if this is the best the film makers can do  they should find something else to do with their miserable lives  like making shoes or delivering mail,0,1,0.44956341608943723
there is absolutely not_plot in this movie    not_character development   not_climax   nothing  but has a few good fighting scenes that are actually pretty good  so there you go   as a movie overall is pretty bad  but if you like a brainless flick that offer nothing but just good action scene then watch this movie  do not_expect nothing more that just that decent acting and a not_so bad direction  a couple of cameos from kimbo and carano   i was looking to see carano a little bit more in this movie  she is a good fighter and a really hot girl     white is a great martial artist and a decent actor  i really hope he can land a better movie in the future so we can really enjoy his art  imagine a film with white and jaa together   that would be awesome,0,1,0.39043519065038007
i have been using imdb for years and i not_wanted to get involved in the commentary of moviesuntil now  this documentary has so many problems that i hardly know what to say  i am not_a muslim  nor am i an islamic studies expert  but i know enough to shed some light on the obvious one sided viewpoint that this documentary espouses  the problems with this movie begin with the fact that it is a documentary  most of the documentaries that i have seen anchor themselves around a few valid points and then surround those points with debatable interpretations and misinformation  this is certainly the case with islam  what the west needs to know  yes  there are fundamentalists around the world  and some of them are muslim  but to build a documentary about all of islam around a small percentage of radicalized people is incredibly misleading  this is really a documentary about the fundamentalist aspects of islam and nothing more for those who would like to more objectively explore some of the issues raised in this documentary  here are several points that may help  there was nothing positive about islam presented in the documentary the documentary focuses on the middle east  but more muslims live outside of that region  more muslims live in china  believe it or not_than in saudi arabia  about 40  of all muslims live in pakistan  bangladesh  india and indonesia the translation of the qur an used in the documentary is a questionable one  i watched the documentary while viewing another translation and the differences were striking  i had been warned about the translation that was used in the documentary and now i know why  surrah 98 6 is a good example  the documentary suggests that the surrah says that disbelievers will go to hell  but the translation i have reads instead   those who reject truth among the people of the book and among the polytheists will be in hellfire   the difference is that those who reject truth are those people who know about god and the truth of god and decide to reject it anyways  the movie mentioned that there is not_morality inherent in islam  but this is not_true  although it is true that much comes from the qur an and hadith  islam also recognizes a concept called  urf or  normative behavior   obviously what is normative can be interpreted many ways  but  urf is meant to be  good  behavior  what an average person would consider right or wrong the documentary presents shar ia  islamic law  as being one unified body of knowledge that all muslims follow  this is simply not_true  there are many islamic schools of law and they range from progressive and modernist to fundamentalist in the way they interpret law  the hadith tradition is similar  there are thousands of hadith and each school of law accepts some and rejects others  using the hadith without serious scholarship to determine which ones are accurate  real and applicable  is indiscriminately picking and choosing quotations from history that fit what you want to say which is what the documentary did what i hope people realize is that fundamentalism is the problem  not_islam or any other religion  christianity has fundamentalists that shoot abortion clinic doctors and so on  i know this is not_the same as suicide bombing  just understand that the righteousness of fundamentalism is arguably the problem  if you feel you have the answer  then everyone else must be wrong  but if you feel you have an answer you can work together with other people s views about politics  religion  god  or whatever,0,1,0.4703265576609222
i ll be honest  the reason i rented this movie was because i am a huge fan of kyle chandler s  most notably from early edition   since he usually plays the good guy  i wanted to see him as in a different role  out of curiosity   the plot itself also drew me in  a wanna be hitman  tony greco  a k a  mr  chandler  must kill a person at random before he is trusted with the life  or  rather  the death  of a witness who will testify against someone in  the family   the movies was nothing like i expected  it was sick  i hated the end  if you saw it  you d know why   and there were so many unnecessary parts  basically  it was filthy  and made little sense  yes  it was a mob movie  and yes the guns do go boom  but there s more to a movie than that  this film acted as if it didn t have the time to go into detail  just deal with it and understand it  the acting really made up for it  james belushi was pretty amusing as  the rose   sheryl lee made angel seem as believable as she could get  she surprised me the most  and kyle chandler was equally convincing as an anxious newcomer to  the family   if only the script did justice to the actors,0,1,0.39801531139162244
i first read  lorna doone  about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it  it is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days  journey from london and law and order was much harder to enforce  sadly  this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion  the acting and production values are ok but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful  why do television adaptations do this  why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story    one of life s great mysteries    the bbc made an excellent version which was televised at christmas in the early 1990s which i am still trying to track down a copy of  take my advice  read the book and don t bother with this paltry version,0,1,0.5245346571487165
this solid little horror film is actually one of renny harlin s best  the story is pretty routine stuff  but the atmosphere is what really makes it come alive  in fact  the ghost story is almost an afterthought  the real horror comes from the prison setting itself  and renny h  spares not_detail in showing us how bad the conditions are inside that crumbling  leaking  rat infested old hellhole  with a sadistic warden  too   viggo mortensen is excellent as usual in the lead role  supported by some very authentic looking prisoners  there are not_pretty boys in this cast   horror fans should check this one out,0,1,0.7871897773612339
it s kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece  i am not_a dullard as far as quality films go  and i will agree that from a technical filming standpoint  as well as for several of the characters portrayed  the film is in an award worthy class  but there is not_sense  for me  of this film actually going anywhere  i mean  taking the viewer anywhere  it is a series of mood scenes  perhaps remarkable as such  but i want more from a film  i look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival  none of which did i find in this film  yes  it might be considered poetry on film       but there is much poetry that i cannot live with for the same reason  that it paints pictures without going anywhere one thing further to be said is that it documents a mid century english childhood  which is necessarily limited in its universality  i was personally appalled at what a young british boy had to live through  in that time and place  having grown up in america just a decade earlier  i can authoritatively say that the contrast is immense  i cannot help wondering if this contrast has had some effect on those reviewing the film so favorably  in other words  could there be a tendency to judge the film entirely on its  filmic magic   which i acknowledge is there  and completely ignore its lack of relevance to the nature of one s actual recalled experience,0,1,0.5883514190078272

anita and me seems to be little more than an excuse for meera syal  the author of the novel and screenplay  to air her prejudices  grievances and general antipathy towards the english  the general sentiment of indian superiority over the english in this film is foul the english people in this film are portrayed as overweight  violent  foul mouthed  promiscuous  engaging in child neglect  stupid  uneducated  racist  ugly  eating poor food  and dim witted    tellingly  only by turning to indian culture can the local priest be  redeemed  at the end of the film by contrast  the indian family are beautiful  clever  educated  can speak many languages  are caring and loving parents  and grammar school fodder  the film is so insidiously prejudicial that i am astonished the bbc funded it at all  had it been the other way round  an english family in an indian community depicted this way  the film would have been seen as racist there were a few moments where my eyebrow shot so far up my forehead  i thought it would lodge in my hairline  first  the gossip scene between the women at the divali celebration    undertext  the english are dirty and promiscuous    and the men    undertext  english women are prostitutes  second  the meal with anita where neema s family lie to her about cutlery    undertext  the english are so stupid  you can make them do anything but the underlying contempt towards anything english    even english weddings are an object of scorn    is evident all the way through the film  the character of anita was drawn so appallingly    almost the fallen woman trope    that i finished the film feeling angry this is not_a  bend it like beckham  where the humour is focused on loving exaggerations of a community s behaviour and customs from somebody within that community  and is a film about two girls from different backgrounds coming together  instead  anita and me seems to convey that a form of cultural apartheid is inevitable  as the english are almost an version of the indian untouchable caste  and this is underscored by a thinly veiled series of attacks upon the film s  other  community  the english i felt anita and me is a hate filled  grievance based piece of work  on that basis  the bbc should not_have funded its production,0,1,0.4773863364709788

was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of ed norton s facial hair  without revealing any plot details  on one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place  it was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard  later on  in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven  this was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldn t be an option  these continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had  also  i found the lengthy scene of the cowboy alone in his bedroom was way too reminiscent of de niro in taxi driver  even if it was meant to be an homage it was laid on too thickly for this viewer,0,1,0.44542636110349604
ritchie s first two films were snappy  stylish entertainment  here  he raids two recent classics    the usual suspects  and  fight club    and still comes out empty handed despite parading itself as a con mystery  with the sub  usual suspects  twaddle  the greatest con he ever pulled was convincing you that he was you  or whatever it was     and attempting a  fight club  twist about which characters are real and which are internal manifestations  the film struggles to maintain interest in its second half  by the last third  you know you re being lead down a blind alley  and tediously slowly at that cons  chess and game theory are all great subjects  but ritchie delves into them too superficially and too repetitively to make much use of the material the only thing that keeps the movie  almost  watchable is ritchie s bold way with with a scene and maurice jones s dynamic camera  if ritchie stuck to a more satisfying plot  and succumbed to tighter editing  there s not_reason why he couldn t have made another enjoyable gangster caper as it is  revolver is a waste of your time  incomprehensibility does not_equal profundity  if you want to see a great film that doesn t make logical sense but makes a virtue of it  and  incidentally  which also involves an inexplicable escape from solitary confinement  watch  lost highway,0,1,0.5132418226322096

john boorman s 1998 the general was hailed as a major comeback  though it s hard to see why on the evidence of the film itself  one of three films made that year about famed northern irish criminal martin cahill  alongside ordinary decent criminal and vicious circles   it has an abundance of incident and style  the film was shot in colour but released in b w scope in some territories  but makes absolutely not_impact and just goes on forever  with a main character who threatens witnesses  car bombs doctors  causes a hundred people to lose their jobs  tries to buy off the sexually abused daughter of one of his gang to keep out of jail and nails one of his own to a snooker table yet still remains a popular local legend an attractive enough personality for his wife to not_approve but actually suggest a ménage a trios with her sister  it needs a charismatic central performance to sell the character and the film  it doesn t get it  instead  it s lumbered with what may well be brendan gleeson s worst and most disinterested performance  he delivers his lines and stands in the right place but there s nothing to suggest either a local hero or the inner workings of a complex character  on the plus side  this helps not_to overglamorize a character who is nothing more than an egotistical thug  but it s at odds with a script that seems to be expecting us to love him and his antics there s a minor section that picks up interest when the ira whips up a local hate campaign against the  general  and his men  painting them as  anti social  drug dealers purely because cahill won t share his loot from a robbery with them  but its temporary resolution is so vaguely shot   something to do with cahill donning a balaclava and joining the protesters which we re expected to find lovably cheeky   that it s just thrown away  things are more successful in the last third as the pressure mounts and his army falls apart  but by then it s too late to really care  adrian dunbar  maria doyle kennedy and the gorgeous angeline ball do good work in adoring supporting roles  but jon voight s hammy garda beat cop seems to be there more for american sales than moral balance  overcompensating for gleeson s comatose non involvement in what feels like a total misfire  come back zardoz  all is forgiven,0,1,0.4456415849966656

the wicker man  starring nicolas cage  is by not_means a good movie  but i can t really say it s one i regret watching  i could go on and on about the negative aspects of the movie  like the terrible acting and the lengthy scenes where cage is looking for the girl  has a hallucination  followed by another hallucination  followed by a dream sequence  with a hallucination  etc   but it s just not_worth dwelling on when it comes to a movie like this  instead  here s five reasons why you should watch the wicker man  even though it s bad  5  it s hard to deny that it has some genuinely creepy ideas to it  the only problem is in its cheesy  unintentionally funny execution  if nothing else  this is a movie that may inspire you to see the original 1973 film  or even read the short story on which it is based 4  for a cheesy horror thriller  it is really aesthetically pleasing  it s pretty obvious that it was filmed on location instead of using green screen or elaborate sets  so we get to see some very great scenery  there are also many nicely composed shots  it is a very good looking movie 3  nicolas cage is not_so much an actor as he is a force of nature  whether you re a fan of his or not_it seems as if it s impossible for cage to play a  normal guy   there is always some kind of eccentricity or nerdiness he brings to the characters he plays  and personally  i am always fascinated by watching him in any movie he does  whether nicolas cage is great or terrible  he always brings his unique energy into play  and he is not_boring to watch  he is terrible in the wicker man  but in the most wonderful kind of way 2  a student could probably write a hell of a paper on this movie  as it seems to be the strongest anti feminist movie ever made   see   you could write   this is what happens when women are allowed to run a society   also  the similarities between this  summersisle  society and a bee colony are pretty interesting and worth noting 1  if you re reading this  there s probably a good chance you may have seen a youtube video that has become very popular  a collection of  highlights  from the movie  including cage running around in a bear suit  and of course  the infamous  aaghh   the bees   my eyes     line  these scenes are hilarious out of context  and they are still fairly funny while watching them in the film s entirety i bought the used dvd at blockbuster for about 5 dollars   when you work that out  it s about a dollar per reason  it s a pretty good deal note  the unrated version of the movie is the best to watch  and it s better to watch the theatrical version just for its little added on epilogue  which features a cameo from james franco,0,1,0.38577719637989066

it should first be said that i have read the manga and therefore my argument is based on the differences this anime greatly disappointed me because it removed the comedy and high quality action of the manga and ova  what it left behind was merely a husk of what it could have been  many of the characters lacked the depth that is seen in the manga  alucard is not_the sympathetic character that secretly wishes for death  walter s story lacks the betrayal  and the nazi villains that plot to engulf the world in war are completely absent  instead  the anime provides the gary stu villain incognito who is defeated against what appear to be all odds my primary complaint is not_that the anime diverges from the manga  but that it does such a poor job,0,1,0.4497522116373594

fox s  the true story of jesse james   1957  is a remarkably poor widescreen remake of their prestigious 1939 tyrone power henry fonda classic  jesse james   i m not_sure where the fault lies but the casting in this version of the two central characters  the uneven direction of nicholas ray and the ham fisted screenplay must surely have something to do with it in the late thirties and forties tyrone power was fox s top leading man but in the fifties his star began to wane and studio head darryl zanuck started to groom newcomer robert wagner to take his place  this was a major error on zanuck s part as wagner proved to be a less than a suitable replacement  with the possible exceptions of  broken lance   1954  and  between heaven   hell   1956  it is hard to think of wagner distinguishing himself in anything  also  jeffrey hunter was nothing more than a fox contract player before being assigned to play frank james to wagner s jesse in  the true story of jesse james   borrowed from the studio the previous year this actor s one distinguishing mark was his excellent and revealing performance in john ford s classic  the searchers   but his playing here  along with wagner as the second half of the james brothers  is nothing short of boring  neither player bring any personality or colour to their respective roles  they totally miss the mark  lacking the charisma and appeal so vividly displayed by power and fonda in the original  the movie is also marred by too many flashbacks and with the all over the place screenplay wagner  as the robin hood of the american west  comes across as a charmless introverted twit that you can feel not_empathy for whatsoever  the supporting cast are hardly worth mentioning but it is a shame to see such a great actress as agnes moorhead barely getting a look in as ma james the best aspects of this uninvolving so so western is the wonderful cinemascope colour cinematography by the great joe mcdonald and the excellent music score by the underrated and little known composer leigh harline,0,1,0.6383481828776683

i ve given up trying to figure out what version of this i m watching  the copyright at the end indicates 1983  and though this is not_the important bit of my objection to this film  i will say that watching a film obviously made in the aquarian age  including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons  but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling  extremely unsettling my main objection here is how dare the filmmakers bury cute as a button pamela franklin alive  how dare they seriously she s all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies i ve seen her in   this crapfest and the otherwise excellent legend of hell house   they kill her off i would like to put the film industry on notice  pamela franklin has apparently retired from the business but if she ever decides to do another film and some blasted cur of a director attempts to kill her off i shall ask him to step outside not_one beats up on pamela franklin and gets away with it  i am quite cross  the fury has been unleashed for b movie fans seeking out a crapfest  you could do much worse than this  on the plus side  this is not_a film which involves satanism in a peripheral and circumspect way   this movie is a hardcore satanic film wall to wall satanic ceremonies  baphomets  hallucinations  a ludicrous rat attack   what else could you ask for this excellent stuff is quite nearly ruined by the baffling grafted on 1980s synth soundtrack  which is about as mismatched to a film as it is possible to be  the soundtrack reminded me of something you d hear on the equalizer  it s really bad also  they made pamela franklin squash her charming english accent  which was also quite rude  if not_a cruel atrocity  against the viewer  such as you might find covered by the universal declaration of human rights  i say that we have a right to hear pamela franklin speak in her own voice  who s with me  i could forgive everything else about this film if they didn t abuse pamela franklin  and so i throw the gauntlet down  sirs    anyone who messes with pamela franklin messes with me even in a fictional context good day  sirs,0,1,0.4880038130716051
i watched this film on the hallmark channel recently  in my opinion  the film started out decent enough  but eventually got sour the story  a u s  soldier in afghanistan receives one of the christmas cards that a woman back in the u s  has sent out to troops for christmas  he becomes so inspired by the christmas card that he feels it has given him a ray of hope and happiness in his life  a motivation to continue on  when he is given leave  he goes to the very town that the woman lives in  he comes across and spunky young woman and eventually finds out that she is the one that sent the christmas card  he meets the family and after saving her dad  a vietnam war veteran  from getting hit by a car whilst crossing the street  the family decides to take him in for a while  we learn that he doesn t have a family back home  the soldier agrees to help out the family during the christmas season by working with them at their logging company  the family comes to love him and vice versa  the soldier also becomes in love with the family s daughter   the woman that sent the christmas card  there s only one problem  she already has a serious relationship with a man that she s in love with  it s also a long distance relationship  the boyfriend is very different from the soldier  he prefers wine and trips to france over hard labor and the great outdoors  the woman prefers the latter  throughout the rest of the film  there is a  love triangle  as the woman s boyfriend is back in town visiting her for the season  everyone in the family seems to want the daughter to be with the soldier and the mom basically wants what s best for her daughter     spoiler alert    the woman comes to like the soldier more and more  as they have a lot in common  they happen to spend a lot of time together  she gradually becomes attracted to his persona  then one day he kisses her and and she kisses him back  now she s so confused  she s in love with her boyfriend and wants to marry him someday  but she s become so fond of the soldier  soon enough  the boyfriend  who doesn t know about the kiss  but is very protective of the woman and thinks the soldier has been trying to move in on her  decides to propose to the woman and she accepts  his plans for their marriage  however  are not_plans that she wants  she wants to be at home  have kids and be close to her family  he wants to travel the world  go to exotic places and if they have kids he wants to take them along  this doesn t sound too thrilling for the woman  however  the soldier feels bad about what he s done and doesn t want to make things worse  so  he decides to leave town  despite the dad s urging him to stay and be with his daughter  it all comes to a head when  at the christmas eve service with church  we find out that the soldier hasn t left yet  the boyfriend and the woman speak to each other outside and he  broken hearted  basically decides to let her go and breaks up with her  the film ends with the woman and the soldier getting together things i like  i like the soldier throughout much of the film  he s basically nice and polite  with a strong sense of doing good for others  there are moments in which the family is going with church and participating in charitable causes  the family hold hands and pray during an evening meal at the table  the dad and mom have a long lasting and evidently healthy marriage  the soldier tries to do the right thing in a situation after he did something very wrong things i don t like  there is a very typical  love triangle  story in this film  the soldier turns sour as he slowly and subtly moves in on the woman and then eventually kisses her when she already has a boyfriend  most of the family practically applauds this behavior   the family goes with church and participates in services  yet this is how they act  there is some bad language conclusion  i became disappointed as the film ran on  and it got worse and worse  i ended up fast forwarding the very end of the film because i had enough  so  the film started out decent with some few gem moments  but ended up ruining itself  therefore  i don t recommend this film to anyone,0,1,0.5137358196315489
today i found  they all laughed  on vhs on sale in a rental  it was a really old and very used vhs  i had not_information about this movie  but i liked the references listed on its cover  the names of peter bogdanovich  audrey hepburn  john ritter and specially dorothy stratten attracted me  the price was very low and i decided to risk and buy it  i searched imdb  and the user rating of 6 0 was an excellent reference  i looked in  mick martin   marsha porter video   dvd guide 2003  and   wow   four stars  so  i decided that i could not_waste more time and immediately see it  indeed  i have just finished watching  they all laughed  and i found it a very boring overrated movie  the characters are badly developed  and i spent lots of minutes to understand their roles in the story  the plot is supposed to be funny  private eyes who fall in love for the women they are chasing   but i have not_laughed along the whole story  the coincidences  in a huge city like new york  are ridiculous  ben gazarra as an attractive and very seductive man  with the women falling for him as if her were a brad pitt  antonio banderas or george clooney  is quite ridiculous  in the end  the greater attractions certainly are the presence of the playboy centerfold and playmate of the year dorothy stratten  murdered by her husband pretty after the release of this movie  and whose life was showed in  star 80  and  death of a centerfold  the dorothy stratten story   the amazing beauty of the sexy patti hansen  the future mrs  keith richards  the always wonderful  even being fifty two years old  audrey hepburn  and the song  amigo   from roberto carlos  although i do not_like him  roberto carlos has been the most popular brazilian singer since the end of the 60 s and is called by his fans as  the king   i will keep this movie in my collection only because of these attractions  manly dorothy stratten   my vote is four title  brazil    muito riso e muita alegria    many laughs and lots of happiness,0,1,0.5667543336487177
i thoroughly enjoyed bilal s graphic novel when it came out  and was amazed when i saw the trailer for this film  and even more so when i found that bilal had directed it himself  the film  however  was a major letdown  the visuals are nowhere near the rich and gritty texture of the original artworks  and the story is poorly told  bilal seems to have chosen to focus on the more esoteric aspects of the graphic novel  and he doesn t do a very good job at it  either the most enjoyable part of the original graphic novel was the friendship hate relationship between nikopol and horus  they were both out of their right time and place  forced together by circumstance  most of all  they were funny and likable  not_so here  nikopol has not_discernible personality whatsoever  and horus is a pompous twit who just wants to get laid  even though the film is french  horus doesn t have to be we have all seen films we enjoyed  but wouldn t recommend to everyone  for some reason or other  i wouldn t recommend immortel to anyone  except maybe as a warning not_to overreach your talent and resources  bilal s a master storyteller  but obviously not_a master of every visual medium,0,1,0.7312503902703752

this movie sounded like it might be entertaining and interesting from its description  but to me it was a bit of a let down  very slow and hard to follow and see what was happening  it was as if the filmmaker took individual pieces of film and threw them in the air and had them spliced together whichever way they landed  definitely not_in sequential order   also  nothing of any consequence was being filmed  i have viewed quite a few different korean films and have noticed that a good portion are well made and require some thinking on the viewer s part  which is different from the typical hollywood film  but this one befuddled me to not_end  i viewed the film a second and third time and it still didn t do anything for me  i still don t really understand what the filmmaker was trying to convey  if it was to just show a typical mundane portion of a person s life  i guess he succeeded  but i was looking for more  needless to say  i can t recommend this movie to anyone,0,1,0.6788207247223741
this movie portrays ruth as a womanizing  hard drinking  gambling  overeating sports figure with a little baseball thrown in  babe ruths early life was quite interesting and this was for all intents and purposes was omitted in this film  also  lou gehrig was barely covered and this was a well know relationship  good bad or indifferent  it should have been covered better than it was  his life was more than all bad  he was an american hero  an icon that a lot of baseball greats patterned their lives after  i feel that i am being fair to the memory of a great baseball player that this film completely ignored  shame on the makers of this film for capitalizing on his faults and not_his greatness,0,1,0.5501421388264431

i have to admit i laughed a few times during this trivial 2004 holiday movie  but it s already moving out of my short term memory  in a career that is sliding rather swiftly toward tabloid obscurity  ben affleck  once a promising comic character actor who became enmeshed in the hollywood publicity machine to recreate himself into a romantic leading man  judging from this film  the transformation doesn t seem to be taking  as he continues to lack the gravitas that would make him credible in such parts  while his buddy matt damon takes on smart roles in films like  syriana   affleck appears in this type of commercial pap  at least the superficial character of successful but lonely advertising executive drew latham suits affleck better than most of the other roles he has tried directed by mike mitchell  whose most famous film is 1999 s  deuce bigelow  male gigolo   and scripted by not_less than four screenwriters  always a bad sign   the flimsy plot revolves around his character s need to  rent  a family living in his childhood home in order to live out his fantasy of having the old fashioned christmas he not_had  the concept is actually intriguing because there is something to be said about the cathartic release of sentimentality we are all directed to feel amid the frenzied commercialism around the holidays  the real problem  however  is that the movie feels like an extended sketch lacking any logic or authentic emotional resonance  affleck seems to be on overdrive attempting desperately to be lovable  but the net result is an exhausting turn by an actor who has an increasingly annoying habit of playing stupid people in ill conceived films  fortunately  he has the likes of james gandofini and catherine o hara playing the valcos  the couple who decide to accept drew s monetary offer to pretend to be his parents gandolfini plays tom like a gruff  non violent relative of tony soprano  but he does what he can in the role  from her classic sctv days to christopher guest s mockumentaries  o hara is always a comic gem not_matter the vehicle  and unsurprisingly she earns the best laughs as tom s wife christine  whether dryly delivering a one liner or posing in an inch of make up for a dominatrix photo shoot  in what is becoming her standard screen role  christina applegate plays their mistrusting daughter alicia  who of course becomes drew s love interest  despite some good moments where she is enjoying the deceit of playing drew s sister in front of his girlfriend s family  her character seems to change in lightning flash strokes making it hard to see what drew would see in her  the story spins completely out of control by the last third with one contrived situation piled on top of another until plot strands are tied together in short order  it s rumored that much of the movie was improvised since there was not_finished shooting script  it shows  but i also have to admit i stuck with it to the bitter end,0,1,0.37213415467098937
elfriede jelinek  not_quite a household name yet  is a winner of the nobel prize for literature  her novel spawned a film that won second prize at cannes and top prizes for the male and female leads  am i a dinosaur in matters of aesthetic appreciation or has art become so debased that anything goes  gobble  gobble  is the favoured orthographic representation in britain of the bubbling noise made by a turkey  in the film world a turkey is a monumental flop as measured by box office receipts or critical reception   gobble  gobble  and the piano teacher are perfect partners the embarrassing awfulness of this widely praised film cannot be overstated  it begins very badly  as if made to annoy the viewer  credits interrupt inconsequential scenes for more than 11 minutes  we are introduced to professor erika kohut  apparently the alter ego of the accoladed authoress  a stony professor of piano  she lives with her husky and domineering mum  dad is an institutionalised madman who dies unseen during what passes for the action reviewing the piano teacher is difficult  beyond registering its unpleasantness  what we see in the film  and might read in the book  for all i know  is a tawdry  exploitative  nonsensical tale of an emotional pendulum that swings hither and thither without moving on erika  whose name is minimally used  is initially shown as a person with intense musical sensitivity but otherwise totally repressed  not_quite  because there s a handbags at two paces scene with her gravelly voiced maman early on that ends with profuse apologies  if a reviewer has to  yawn  extract a leitmotif  why not_use a pretentious word when a simpler one would do   elrika s violently alternating moods would be it a young hunk  walter  studying to become a  low voltage  engineer  whatever that is  and playing ice hockey in his few leisure moments  is also a talented pianist  he encounters elrika at an old fashioned recital in a luxury apartment in what may or may not_be paris  in the glib fashion of so much art  he immediately falls in love and starts to  cherchez la femme  repressed erika has a liking for hardcore pornography  shown briefly but graphically for a few seconds while she sniffs a tissue taken from the waste basket in the private booth where she watches walter performs a brilliant audition and is grudgingly accepted as a private student by erika  whose teaching style is characterised by remoteness  hostility  discouragement and humiliation he soon declares his love and before long pursues erika into the ladies where they engage in mild hanky panky and incomplete oral sex  erika retains control over her lovesick swain  she promises to send him a letter of instruction for further pleasurable exchanges in the meantime  chillingly jealous because of walter s kindness to a nervous student who is literally having the shits before a rehearsal for some future concert  erika fills the student s coat pocket with broken glass  causing severe lacerations to those delicate piano playing hands the next big scene  by passing the genital self mutilation  etc  has walter turning up at the apartment erika shares with her mother  erika want to be humiliated  bound  slapped  etc  sensible walter is  for the moment  repulsed and marches off into the night at this point there s still nearly an hour to go  the viewer can only fear the worst  erika tracks down walter to the skating rink where he does his ice hockey practice  they retire to a back room  lusty wally is unable to resist the hands tugging at his trousers  his  baby gravy  is soon expelled with other stomach contents  ho hum repulsed but hooked  perhaps desirous of revenge for the insult so recently barfed on the floor  walter returns to erika s apartment  can you guess what happens now  it s not_very deep or difficult  yes  he becomes a brute while erika becomes a victim  one moment he s locking maman in her room and slapping erika  the next he s kicking her in the face  having sex with her and renewing his declarations of love  am i being unfair in this summary  watch the film if you want  but i d advise you not_to anyone can see eternity in a grain of sand if they re in the right mood  i could expatiate at the challenging depiction of human relationships conveyed by this film if i wanted  but i  prefer not_to   because this is a cheap and nasty film that appeals to base instincts and says nothing i m supposed to say that parentally repressed erika longs for love  ineffectively seeks it in pornography  inappropriately rejects it when it literally appears  pink and throbbing  under her nose  belatedly realises that she doesn t like being hurt  blah  blah  blah the world has  for reasons not_explained  stunted her  she apparently makes a monster out of someone who appeared superficially loving   but surely we all know that any man is potentially a violent rapist  because that s his essential nature however much he tries to tell himself and the world otherwise at the end  if you have the patience to be there  there s a small twist  before going to the final scene  where she s due to perform as a substitute for the underwear soiling student with the lacerated hands  erika packs a knife in her handbag  for walter yes  you re ahead of me  she stabs herself in a none life threatening area and leaves  roll credits if this earned the second prize at cannes  just how bad were the rest of the entries,0,1,0.39057975747824775

very low budget police procedural film about homicide detectives trying to solve the murder of a woman whose body turns up in a stolen car in central park  and their only clue is a tattoo on her arm  although released by rko  this has the look of an independent production that was picked up by the studio for distribution  the cast and crew  with a few exceptions  among them a young and uncredited jack lord  director edward montagne and cameraman william steiner  are comprised of complete unknowns  and it shows  the performances are universally sub par and wouldn t pass muster in a high school training film  the direction is stodgy and choppy and  as mentioned previously  there s not_chemistry whatsoever between the lead actors  however  despite the film s many shortcomings  it does have a few good points  the location shooting in new york city  and the film s ultra low budget  gives it a gritty authenticity much like that of the far superior  the naked city   a shootout in a dark basement is decently handled  and some of the investigating procedures are clever  otherwise  it s not_much to write home about  it is worth a look  however  for a glimpse at the seamier sections of new york city in the early 1950s  and old car buffs will be ecstatic to see the legions of  30s and  40s cars in the streets,0,1,0.4798837050775105

welcome to our town  welcome to your town  as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america  this three act play is opened before us with the help of  the stage manager   a visual narrator if you like  after his initial introductions  we are lead into the homes of two particular families  the webb s and the gibb s this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century  and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town  here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover s corners  new hampshire  even if there are  too  the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers  they  not_get a look in once the daily lives of these families have been introduced  wives cooking  children home working  fathers working  kids falling in love and the clean picket fences painted white  the second act is started three years later  after young george  a young and unrecognisable william holden  then aged 22  and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry  blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching  too  a turning point in their own lives  from the nest they lived and now  into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step  the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding  it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent  here we see not_life  not_celebration but death  and it is in this predicament that the dead  as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past  are here to remind us  to tell us  that life  and every last minute  every precious breath is not_to be wasted and squandered it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too  feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on  and by  middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order  this isn t just about  our  town  this is moral diction aimed at  our  souls and how america can better itself if its peoples    excluding the poles  the irish  the native american and the freed ethnic minorities   and minorities  in general  plus the supporting backbone of the americana s who  still  have not_had a fair part in this narrative   such as the middle classes  can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest  decent living  the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only i was entertained  slightly  by this movie too  but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting  the musical score or how well  or not_it was made  this was the movies intention to exclude other groups  and to only include the likes of the webb s and the gibb s  in the future of the developing country of the usa  a good movie  but also a slightly biased in its stance  i thought taken from the play by us  born thornton wilder  1897   1975  this pulitzer prize winning play  and six academy award nominated movie  was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes  life  love and death  the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness  our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness  like other towns  nothing too exciting ever happens here  if anything at all  this town only has the  right sort of people   you can still leave your back door unlocked here  we are seeing the developing lives of these two families  but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves  our town may just have been  any town   just as long as you came from the right part of town that is,0,1,0.8683716898048556
another variation and improvisation on the famous and beloved children tale  la bete  1975  aka the beast tries to imagine  in very graphic and what may seem offensive and disturbing but in reality rather silly and comical way   what actually happened between beauty and the beast  i am amused by many reviews and comments that seem to look too deeply into this movie  i would not_go so far as saying that it is a serious and dark exploration of such subjects as sexual frustration  longing  fulfillment  or satirical criticizing of the catholic religion  i would not_even call it a horror erotic movie  it s more of the parody on all genres it touches or mentions even though it s got some shocking moments in all departments that sure will stay in your memory the long  way too long  scene between an aristocratic young woman and the supposedly horrifying but the most laughable i ve ever seen in the movies creature with truly impressive   well anatomy  is set to the clavichord music of scarlatti and is hysterical  my husband and i both laughed out loud at the exaggerated details of the encounter  the moral of the scene is   beauty can and will defeat the monster  the question is   who is the target audience for the film  for an erotic picture  it is too verbose  for an art movie   it s got too many jaw dropping scenes of sheer madness and i d say an abrupt ending  imo  the film creator did not_mean for it to be a serious drama  as a parody of art house horror erotica  it is funny and certainly original  have a good laugh and try not_to look for some deep meaning  this story of the curious beauties and the lustful beasts certainly is not_recommended for co viewing with the children  the opening scene that may shock an unprepared viewer much more than the infamous scene of bestiality can be successfully used on discovery channel for the program like  in the world of animals   mating habits and rituals of horses,0,1,0.5075933553889002
once upon a time in the mid 1990s i used to write for doctor who fanzines and the whole of fandom was holding its breathe about the new american produced doctor who tvm   as soon as it was announced that the doctor s arch enemy the master was going to be played by eric roberts everyone scratched their heads and exclaimed   who is eric roberts       i should point out this was before the imdb came online when all you had to do was type in a name into this website to their resume   but one helpful soul wrote into a publication i wrote for to explain that eric roberts was best known for a role where he starred opposite f murray abraham   the film was called by the sword and was about a fencing school   actually looking back now roberts is best known for the pope of greenwich village and runaway train but that didn t stop the person putting the boot into both roberts and by the sword and his mind was made up that this american master with his southern drawl was going to a debacle   strangely most fans were furious about roberts playing the master but after they saw the doctor who tvm a great many fans   myself among them   thought roberts performance was the best thing about the disappointing american production yeah i m digressing but by the sword was a film that i wanted to see simply because it was the first time i d heard the name of eric roberts but i didn t get the chance to see it untill this weekend and i was fairly disappointed with it   i know nothing about fencing   everyone else on this page seems duty bound to mention if they fence or not_i don t fence   so i don t know how accurate it all is   but as mentioned the film feels somewhat anachronistic even if you saw it on its release in 1991   the hairstyles seem a few years out of date along with its mixed teenage cast doing a little dance routine that makes you wonder if it wouldn t have worked a lot better if it d had been produced by jerry bruckheimer in the mid 1980s   you could argue this would have meant the relationship between max suba and alexander villard being off centre for most of the film but i wasn t convinced about their love hate relationship and abraham and roberts have given much better performances before and since by the sword,0,1,0.6604615546413829
i imagine when hitchcock scholars and experts find themselves together  the talk is not_of the master s great films like  north by northwest  or  strangers on a train   but a lesser known effort like this one from 1931  obscure and seriously flawed  which showcases the great director in fledgling form emily and fred hill  joan barry and harry kendall  are a middle class london couple scrimping to stay ahead  he begrudges their lot  she accepts it  change comes in the form of a letter from an uncle  saying he will set them up so they can enjoy a life of globetrotting luxury  they make plans for a world cruise  but their problems have only begun just ask richard hannay  roger o  thornhill  or marion crane  well  marion s indisposed at the moment  but you get the idea  travel and hitchcock go together like moths and candlelight  setting one up for a perilous journey at best  this is perhaps hitchcock s earliest foray into this theme  and not_his most successful or memorable  hitchcock tries to mix comedy with another element  in this case domestic drama rather than suspense  but the two do not_cohere  at least not_here the hills are a dull  flat couple  with not_chemistry or personality  when they find themselves at the folies bergère  in the form of cross cutting with footage that looks ten years older than the rest of this film  they are abashed at the outfits of the female performers   the curtain s gone up too soon   gasps emily   they aren t dressed  when the hills drift away from each other on an ocean cruise  it seems a mercy killing more than a tragic thing  even if the people they partner off with are drips  too  emily s man  gordon  percy marmont  carries around photographs of himself sitting next to empty chairs  which he suggests be filled by emily  fred s girl  the princess   betty amann  has clara bow s eyes and wallace beery s five o clock shadow  there s also an obnoxious fellow passenger  a dowdy spinster whom hitchcock always introduces with a cartoonish horn cue  subtlety was still to come everything is shot in an abrupt manner  with confusing blocking and strained dialogue  hitchcock tries for some early comedy with fred and his umbrella that doesn t come off  and kendall seems to aim for laughs while berry plays for tears  when fred and emily break off  they are seen being jostled on a pair of wedged together rickshaws  one of many clunky attempts at symbolism emily s the only vaguely sympathetic character  in part because she really cares about her husband and agonizes over her affair with gordon  but mostly because she s among the first of hitchcock s many magnetic blondes  her platinum ringlets whipping around her face like a botticelli aboard the open deck of a chinese junk near the film s conclusion matters conclude with a dangerous situation as set piece for the protagonists to come to grips with  and presumably repair their relationship  only they aren t active participants in the resolution  and except for the fate of a friendly cat  nothing about the ending resonates at least you get some enjoyable views of london in the early 1930s  and a chance to see hitchcock when he was still working for food   rich and strange  is hitchcock paying his dues  and learning his trade  one for scholars but not_casual film goers,0,1,0.6071905385689664

this is your only spoiler warning  what a sad state of our cinema when unprofessional junk like this is considered  oscar worthy  i divide material into three levels  the first is the stage theatre  here the viewer is stagnant and the power rests in the presentation of the actor and  most importantly  in the power of the writer  a good playwright is better than a good screenwriter because he or she knows the ways of words better  the best playwrights know how to create imagery that the barren stage cannot show the second level is film  in this medium  a weaker writer can be used  but the viewer is not_sitting in one spot the entire time  with film  the context can take the qualities of visual poetry and meaning in addition to strong writing  furthermore  film can manipulate everday elements like sound and color in ways that are almost surreal the final level is literature  in this context  everything is imagined by the author  translated onto paper  and then re imagined by the reader  far more detail can go into a novel than is conceivable for a film studio this is why adaptations can go up  but not_down  novelizations are not_better than the base film  see the dime per dozen ones at your local book store   whereas the film cannot convey the same power as the original book  catch 22 and lotr   movies can rarely be made into plays and plays can always be made into movies as for  the last picture show   it fails  it is a film that should stick to the stage because the director is too stupid to shoot anything right  the characters talk the same and act the same  it s pure futility  add to that an obnoxious soundtrack and you have an entirely unwatchable film i saw this in my high school drama class with about 20 other wannabe thespians  the instructor raved about how sad the movie was  what is sad is how such stagnant work is considered depressing when the material itself is hilarious  had this been in color the scenes of impotence  the pool party  and the old hooker would be considered great comedy  look what lucas did with  american graffiti  a few years later the american secondary education system needs to start teaching about film rather than trying to teach with film  two visually powerful downbeat films  apocalypse now and barry lyndon  rely on them  not_this  it s the  last  i want to see of it  1 out of 5,0,1,0.3865166238200422

when evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the usa you must consider the following  the united states of america with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold human rights that it has its failings and downside  it is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra  conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated   on a per capita basis europe  britain and even australia have similar right wing groups in fact on a per capta basis the actual size of neo nazi groups in australia is actually higher than in the united states of america  it is for the above reasons that it is unjustifiable to demean and vilify the american people and their level of debate in educated american society by very fraudulently and deceptively presenting this ultra right wing bunch of psychopaths as being representative of american society  by doing so greenstreet  deliberately chose small and isolated groups at opposite ends of the spectrum to construct an image of america that is an outrageous and deliberate sensationalist lie  this film is clearly designed to inflame and pander to the views of people who harbor this subconscious and morbid hate the american people and way of life under the guise of spurist fashionable and cliché idealist left wing ideology  this film was made for profit not_for furthering the truth about american society and the human condition  greenstreet can make documentaries that focus on ultra right wing conspiracies  the military industrial complex but fail miserably to present an intelligent and balanced factual debate let alone alternative solutions to the failings of a vibrant democracy  movie show is exposed as anti american by its support for this trash  sensationalism at its worst anti  usa garbage shameful,0,1,0.5810274980644675

a seemingly endless movie that really deserves a zero rating  the premise seems simple enough  yentl  a girl interested in studying the talmud  wants to go to school  but only boys are allowed to study  so after her father s death she decides to disguise herself as a boy to get in  she does and becomes close friends with avigdor  who is to be married to a beautiful woman named hadass  hadass  family learns avigdor s brother committed suicide  and the wedding is called off  yentl  now calling herself anschel  is then selected to marry hadass  she does but it is not_consummated  yentl anschel and avigdor go away for a few days  and yentl anschel reveals her secret to him  the movie ends with avigdor returning to  and marrying   hadass  and yentl going to america to continue her studies although she will have to continue to do so in disguise the plot above seems interesting at first for a movie over 2 hours long  but there are several things that ruin it  for starters  there is the constant singing   i can already hear the critics shouting   yes  i know this is a musical so there are supposed to be lots of songs and dance numbers  but the movie could have been improved if it were directed and played without them  the songs become tedious after a while  and there isn t as much dancing as one would expect  many of the songs are forgettable  with not_real memorable lyrics  and those with any significance could easily have been substituted by a voice over  only one song stands out from the rest   papa can you hear me   it is obvious that most of the others were deliberately placed so streisand could simply have a reason to show off her vocal abilities every five to ten minutes  chances are anyone who will see this film will already know what a superb singer and actress she is  so the songs really aren t necessary  second  streisand s makeup  which can be seen during her scenes as a man  the lipstick  enhanced lashes  and traces of blush are all obvious  makes it hard for the audience to believe in the yentl anschel character  that she is actually serious  and fooling her new friends  colleagues  and even hadass  into believing she is a man  yet we are asked and expected to believe that very thing  there seems to be a contradiction  as her character talks  or rather sings  of how she doesn t think she can pull it off  but is surprised that everyone seems to be fooled because she is wearing men s clothing  this means that we are then expected to believe the other characters are so naive they can t see the other differences  such as her actions  which are clear giveaways  the facial differences alone cannot be included  as other characters in the film mention that some of their male relatives or friends didn t have a beard or other facial hair  nevertheless  in the 1900s  if a woman dressed as a man  but wore as much makeup as streisand s character did  and still tried to pass herself off as a man solely because she wore men s clothing  it would have been deemed unacceptable and caused an outrage  chances are she would probably be forced to leave the town  or even the country  therefore the  feminine  makeup on streisand does not_lend to the character s credibility  and only weakens the plot  if it was only applied to make streisand look more beautiful  it should have been scrapped  thirdly  when yentl anschel herself reveals who she truly is toward the end  we are then asked to believe that the other characters are not_as smart as streisand s and only when they learn the  truth  do they become a little wiser  by now it becomes more and more apparent that the whole plot is so far fetched that it is nothing more than a custom made vehicle for streisand to fuel lastly  there are those who are fans of streisand who will find not_fault with this film  its plot  or the songs  to those i must respectfully disagree  while she has excellent vocal and acting abilities  i am not_a  fan  of her style of singing  however  i have enjoyed many of her other features including musicals  there are even some songs of hers that i like  so i am not_a  hater  nor have set out to bash her  i have written this review from an honest perspective  from someone who has tried their best to watch this movie   several times even   and has noted the problems within  if streisand was interested in creating a great or even believable film  she could have done so here by not_injecting her need to show off and prove how talented  beautiful and smart she is at nearly every turn  this movie does nothing more than hurt her abilities  make her appear self absorbed  and thus turn the film into a laugh fest unworthy of her fans or audience,0,1,0.4633717607902713

i purchased the blood castle dvd on ebay for a few bucks not_knowing what it was and all i can say is that i wasn t disappointed with this purchase  blood castle is one of those trashy european horror films that has almost not_redeeming quality except for being thoroughly entertaining  for all the bad reasons  the opening alone was worth the price of the dvd  our heroine  dr  ivanna  arrives at the castle where she s supposed to help a scientist  baron dalmar  who does experiments on dead tissue  on her way to the castle 1  a man tries to rape ivanna  2  the castle s housekeeper fights with her  3  the maid wants her dead  4  and finally  baron dalmar nearly spits on her and wants her out the next day  hmm   something tells me she s not_welcome  with such a miserable arrival  you d think ivanna would leave the place in a ny minute but not_like so many great trashy films  our  headstrong  heroine decides to stay put and even enjoys a candlelight dinner with the grumpy baron on that same eventful day  the intro is so over the top trashy  it s even greater than the memorable first few minutes of that canadian film  junior  that i knew i was going to enjoy this but the fun doesn t end there  ivanna is repeatedly drugged whenever she goes to bed at night  only to wake up from unconsciousness  naked  bound and tortured in mild sessions of s m by an unseen man  even after experiencing these nightly s m sessions  ivanna stays at the castle  dully convinced by the angry baron that what she s experiencing are nothing more than dreams  to be expected  even after being treated so badly from the get go  ivanna  falls in love with the baron  ivanna completely disregards anything negative about him  including the obvious fact that the dour baron is popular with the young ladies  every women at the castle  it seems only women work there  is in love with the miserable chump  who doesn t mind taking advantage of the pretty young things  things get even sillier as someone lurks around the estate and kills  and has been killing  women  basically  the baron s physically disfigured brother  igor is responsible for everything  in a very long winded scene  the brother warns the baron he should not_get too involved with ivanna or he ll suffer the consequences  so what do the baron and ivanna do about this  well  they get married of course  during the very brief marriage ceremony  the baron is shot by one of the angry locals  father of one of the dead girls   but all of this doesn t deter ivanna  who  amidst all the dead young ladies and torture surrounding them  cheerfully comforts the hurt baron that  it s just a flesh wound  and the two can go on and enjoy their honeymoon at the castle  where the killer rapist torturer brother is  the whole thing quickly devolves into a nightmarish love triangle of sorts  between ivana  the baron and igor  blame it all on love anyway  you get the idea  subtle it s not_almost everything is over the top ridiculous in this film and when it s not_ott  such as the predictable climax  things get a tad boring  but for most of the film  the director or writer revel in one illogically trashy moment after another  i really love these kind of films  everything as subtle as being hit over the head with a sledgehammer  and populated by characters behaving illogically  even those who made the retromedia dvd realize this and when you go to the scene selection section  we hear one of the funniest bits of dialogue from the dubbed movie looped endlessly  the production values are beautifully risible  the opening and closing credits  with those candles and red curtains   ah  a soupçon of class  the music sounds sometimes like something from a tim burton film  which only adds to the oddness of it all  and customary to these kind of films  when the young ladies take off their clothes  they just beg to be killed as a standard film  i rate this a 2  but as a  it s so bad it s good  film  i rate it a solid 8 stars  if you enjoy trashy films  please watch this one  it s a must see  the only thing left for me to ponder about it  what would it have taken for that woman to get out of that freaking castle,0,1,0.5475540350517729
you have to admire brad sykes even if you don t particularly want to  a man who churns out budget horror after budget horror to less than enthusiastic receptions  but keeps on doing it all the same  even the half hearted praise than surrounds his camp blood films is given grudgingly and i m as guilty of this as anyone  brad normally manages to throw something interesting into the mix  a neat idea  a kooky character  whatever  but without the funds to take it further than base level  he relies on the audience to cut him some slack and appreciate it for what it is and what it could be  joe haggerty gives a spirited and very funny performance as ebenezer jackson and its a credit to sykes that he can sense that this oddball turn is going to work within the framework of the film  coming to a multiplex near you  in a parallel universe  somewhere,0,1,0.5387404297380701

okay like most steven seagal fans i know i not_going expect a masterpiece every time he makes a film but i do expect the film to at least have some sorter budget  the main problem with the copy i watched was the terrible over dubbing i know that in some films this has to be done and i accept that but when they overdub with a totally different actors voice and keep doing this thru out the film it does take the magic of overdubbing away  also the sets seem to be built with not_care as in one scene the sliding glass top in a top secret lab has a massive crack going thru it  i was truly disappointed with this film and only hope stevens next project will be more finished off before sending the film out for buying renting  the story of this film had me wondering if i was watching a sci fi film or not_some parts seemed alien like but they not_explained what was going on i found it very confusing,0,1,0.3667001285364243

this movie is not_that interesting  except for the first ten minutes  the pace and editing are a perfect introduction in an ensemble piece  even better than say gosford park  then it inexplicably slows down  loses focus and starts resembling a traditional french movie only to regain focus in the end with the love relation between antoine  depardieu  and cécile  deneuve   in the middle there are too many sidelines and loose ends in the story  several threads started are not_ended        spoilers ahead the main story is the relation between antoine and cécile  he has been loyal to her after his relation with her many years ago  despite her remarrying and setting up home in morocco  as builder he now rebuilds his own life and recovers hers by taking the mask of cécile s marriage  having accomplished this  he is buried after a freak accident  literally  and becomes a comatose  he wakes only after she has burned their old picture as indication that they ve reconciled with the past and can properly start their lives again together         end of spoilersit remains unclear what vision this director wants us to see us because there are so many other stories here  illegal immigrants want to enter europe  there are frequent radio broadcasts about the overthrow of iraq s former regime  cécile s child is bisexual and is bitten by dogs  loyalty  once he meets his boyfriend  whereas the girl he lives with seems to be sick  of that    her sister is traditional islamic  and enters a relation with cécile s husband  it portrays morocco as unnecessary backward  despite all the building there is a strange colonial vision shining through that almost glorifies the past  it portrays islam as backward and prone to extremism  which may sometimes be true  but certainly not_in general  in the end it can all best be described as adding some couleur locale and l art pour l art deneuve and depardieu are great  with this material they are so familiar they are able to spin something extra in every scene  lifting an eyebrow  body language  radiating pride  awkward behavior  the movie itself is disappointing and only confirming the limited role of french cinema in the world nowadays  with some notable exceptions of course,0,1,0.7764126545307827

nobody knows anybody  is a conspiracy theory thriller about a satanist nut bomber targeting the religious festivities of seville during holy week  he also happens to be the best friend of the film s hero  the plot is set up by the bomber as a computer game  with himself and the hero as players  and seville as the virtual environment  the very real alleys and streets of the city begin to take on the labyrinthine qualities of those old pacman type games  looked at this way  the scene where the hero and his female sidekick are chased by black hooded penitents with rayguns may not_seem as silly as it plays  from the start  we are aware that the narrative is being constructed as a game   the hero s job is to create crossword puzzles for a popular newspaper  at one point  the crossword grid on his screen becomes the chessboard on which he is later playing against his girlfriend s father  clues are liberally scattered  as the camera mystifyingly closes in on images that are only later shown to have been significant  e g  the advert in the bar   the detective paper chase elements are made part of a game in progress  rather than an investigation after the fact  the film borrows heavily on  se7en  s pattern narrative  and anyone with a catholic education will presumably get the significance of certain events happening on certain days in the run up to easter in this reading  the game is on the level of narrative  with the hero fighting against an enemy  in this case  the computer  to win and save the day  but there is a second game  the film itself  which subvert the first  there are another set of of clues which point not_to the killer s intentions  but the filmmaker s and his hero s  in the first ten minutes there are references to chess  a writer called navokov and a cult leader called sarin  if we remember that the chess loving nabokov s 1930s pseudonym was sirin  we see another game afoot  one where we suspect not_the villain  but the hero himself  in a nabokov novel like  pale fire   an author figure creates a text which is designed to hide his own motives  provoking a game between writer and reader to uncover the real text  throughout the film are scenes which are visually distorted  e g  the image contracting   or which are ambiguously defined dreams and hallucinations that make us suspect the hero s point of view  the opening references to games are all linked to him  in the early sequences  much is made of the character s sexual and creative impotence  so the film could be his attempt to master his life  to be a winner  in a way he can t for real  not_sooner has he won the game than his writer s block vanishes  the words he types are the title of the film  suggesting he is the overall author  further  that title in spanish reflects on itself negatively  a very nabokovian involution that suggests a hero  like kinbote  trapped in his own solecism this jumble of post modern literature  borges  eco  pynchon et al are alluded to also   fincher   x files    run lola run   chris marker  the idea of the city and its history as a map and a text  and as a cultural history haunting the present   bunuellian anti clericism  and alex de la iglesia s  shock  films result in a film that is just that  a jumble  each clever clever allusive element cancelling out the last  dissipating interest  the lack of clarity about the game s rules renders it incomprehensible  and eventually wearing  ironically  in a work of such overdetermined artifice  the film s main interest lies in its documentary quality  as a record of a narrative taking place in a real city with its own events taking place independently  such an ambiguous blurring of fact and fiction can create a masterpiece like  sans soleil  or  london   but  ultimately  you need to have a light touch to match your cleverness,0,1,0.4975053306425837

the films of upa are surprisingly well rated on imdb despite the fact that the animation quality is light years behind that of looney toons  disney and mgm at their prime  sadly  due to rising costs in making pretty cartoons with high frame rates and lovely backgrounds  the upa style  which debuted about 1950  began to dominate in the late 50s and 60s  after all  the films were dirt cheap to make and they d received several oscars to  prove  that the cartoons were now mainstream  so as a result  lousy animation was becoming the norm and this trend wasn t reversed until the 1980s this upa film is one of the early ones  the characters are very simply drawn  any simpler and they would have used stick figures  and the backgrounds were ugly  simple line drawings with colors added in a very slap dash manner  often with a sponge and rarely completely filling the items  as for the story  it s a jive story with a strong jazz style attitude  some will love this  others will just find it very  very loud  it s the traditional  frankie and johnny  story and because of the shootings and all  it s probably not_a great film for the kids  heck  because of the animation and jazz  it s not_a particularly good film for me  either  some will read my review and not_doubt think i am a crank  which i am  to a degree   however  i love animated films and a little of this minimalistic upa style goes a very  very long way and you can t seriously consider them great works of art  just very  very quickly made cartoons  ignore the oscars and try watching some classic cartoons or something  anything else,0,1,0.7777389233728278
the lives of the saints starts off with an atmospheric vision of london as a bustling city of busy  quaint streets and sunshine  i was hoping it would maintain this atmosphere  but it gets bogged down in a story that goes pretty much nowhere othello works for big  fat mr  karva  his crime boss step dad  at least i think that is what he is supposed to be because it s not_defined  but he does drop kittens into deep fat friers  so trust me  he s a prick  doing scrappy little errands while his skanky girlfriend gives daddy hand jobs  one of his colleagues is runner  a black dude who is always dashing from a to b  until the day he comes across almost mute homeless child who grants him his wish of being able to stop running  runner dumps the lost boy in othello s flat  where he promptly starts granting more wishes  keen to have some of his own desires fulfilled  karva has the boy kidnapped  but he isn t sure of what would really bring him happiness  is it the innocence of being a child again or is it another hand job  either way  i don t want to see the little boy grant him the second it just takes ages to get going and there are loads of repetitive scenes  the ending tries to be shocking but since there s hardly any back story on investment in any of these characters it only serves as a release for the bored audience writer tony grisoni  a favourite of terry gilliam  tries to blend in some kind of religious allegory which ends up being pretentious as all hell  ironically  if he gave us something more accessible or at least had better explanations for the characters suddenly acting all weird then it would have been a more enjoyable film  as it is  we are introduced to a bunch of annoying loudmouths who then miraculously seem to develop intelligence when confronted by the mysterious boy  who s origins are not_revealed  that s just plain irritating  aside from sporadic moments of atmosphere and a moody score  this film has little to recommend,0,1,0.38280170021855625

i saw this film in its premier week in 1975  i was 13 years old and at that time i found it adequate and somewhat fun  i then came to discover the world of doc savage through the bantam novels of the old pulp magazine stories  i had not_idea before any of this of the realm of doc  but i fast became one of the most avid doc savage fans you could ever meet  i read  and still own  all of the bantam books  i started going to comic book cons  along with star trek and doctor who and all manner of geeky fat kid events  and had a wonderful time with each adventure i took with doc and the original fab 5  philip jose farmer s book   the apocalyptic life of doc savage became a bit of a bible for me and to this day i have very fond feelings regarding my doc phase  in so saying i have to admit now years later that this film really missed the boat  it is a film that did not_know what it wanted to be when it grew up  the screenplay was infantile and bore little resemblance to the pulp story  these stories from the 30 s were short and if one looked at lester dent s  aka kenneth robeson  outline for writing them  they broke down into perfect 3 act dramas that screamed for screen treatment  one would have thought that with george pal and michael anderson at the helm  it would have turned out better  the spoof elements miss the target and the more serious moments almost get there  but then fall short  it is interesting to watch though in that they hired second string character actors  guys that had really been only bit players and extras before this film  who all acquit themselves very well  paul gleason of course has gone on to be a fine utility player in all facets of entertainment and bill lucking is a television perennial  all the rest have fallen off the map sadly  i do wish to own a copy of this film as it is the only movie version of my hero  but i fear i will not_watch it much as it is too painful  i would say 0 but i give it 2 out of 10 instead for some of the period art direction  doc s answering machine at the end was a nice touch  and the cast of 3rd stingers getting a moment in the sun,0,1,0.7140015701695037
in spite of having some exciting  and daring  sequences  nbtn just not_gets going  there are exploding boats  hat pin murders  mass suicides  pathologists with body parts  and all sorts of classic mystery horror scenes  but they re interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition  everybody in the movie looks bored  this is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmed add to this the  too proper  brit characters and you feel like you ve drifted into a sherlock holmes movie finally  the cinematography is very ordinary  there are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside  or complex shots of someone being pulled into a huge bonfire  but the whole thing is unimaginative and dull definitely only for lee and cushing fans,0,1,0.4579065890893096
the 1930  were a golden age of los angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy  people were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams  expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom  majority then condemned to live starving  disillusioned and unwanted  searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms  young italian american writer arturo bandini arrives to la on a similar quest   to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path  having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology  wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though  occasionally  he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive  he is proud to present himself as an italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his italian origin as a burden  the little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend  the coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a not_ending relationship of insults  unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath  camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive us citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non perspective racial heritage  though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful mexican woman is much harder to deal with than arturo is able to realize  is it obvious that arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel  is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun  is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn it is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters  performed by salma hayek and colin farrell  does not_work  the relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings  hayek though livelier a character compared to farrell s forgot to arm camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character frida  also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences  a tougher character of a phil marlowe sort would definitely suit farrell better  though he looks stunning in a period costume  he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself  feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not_right  their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm  far from real passion  feelings just described not_felt inside  it is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted  turned into a grey average of soon to be forgotten,0,1,0.8933598582461468
this is a very old and cheaply made film  a typical low budget b western in so many ways  gary cooper was not_yet a star and this film is highly reminiscent of the early films of john wayne that were done for  poverty row  studios  with both actors  their familiar style and persona were still not_formed  this incarnation of gary cooper doesn t seem exactly like the cooper of just a few years later  he talks faster in this early film  among other things  however  unlike the average b movie of the era  there are at least a few interesting elements that make the film unique  if not_good   if you ever want to see the woman that was married to errol flynn for seven years  this is your chance  lili damita stars as the female love interest and this is a very  very odd casting choice  as she has a heavy accent  she was french  and wasn t even close to being  movie star pretty   incidentally  she was also married to director michael curtiz  but for me  the most memorable and weird aspect of the film is the seemingly gay subplot  sort of like a brokeback mountain from the 1930s  and we thought this was a new idea   gary cooper s character was raised by two men who hate women and do everything they can through much of the film to keep cooper clear of females  this misogyny alone doesn t necessarily mean much  but there are so many clues throughout the film that indicate the makers of the film really were trying to portray them as a gay couple  in particular  towards the end  when one of them is killed  the other is shot by an arrow and holds off dying long enough to crawl over to the body of his fallen friend and then falls  with his arms cradled around him  this was pretty edgy stuff for the time and i think this makes this dull film really fascinating today  as far as cooper and the plot go  the film is a bit of a disappointment and very skip able  unless you are curious about damita or the homosexual undertones  do yourself a favor and find a better western,0,1,0.441143367342349
how many fricken  times do we have to see a spook walking by in the background   peaking through a mirror s reflection  it s been done in two dozen movies in recent memory   four dozen times in this choppy  poorly done film  there were only two freaky moments to appreciate    when the ghosts invaded the personal spaces of two characters  speaking of characters  the acting was as flat as the diet coke in the 64 oz  cup i was drawing it from  the side characters could have been pulled from various scooby doo cartoons  there was the friendly  aged sheriff  there was the kooky weirdo living in the backwoods with the alabama drawl  lots o characters with not_development  the most disturbing image was that of a murdered child in the beginning  but rather than explore the child s murder  which would have been interesting  they just let us know that she was dead   her parents had a hard time reconciling her death with the community   each other  when they reach the cabin  the scenes rarely flowed together    with flashing images of the dead daughter interjected here   there  oh   and the eerie sounds were also overdone  you know what i mean    creaking doors that open by themselves  crickets in the forest  yada yada yada  ooooohhhh  haven t seen that before  again  you ll see the amazing self opening door in the movie over and over an over again  note to director  a scary scene is only scary if it s not_repeated every 5 minutes in the same film  think these things out before calling out  it s a wrap,0,1,0.38073933428151574
i used to always love the bill because of its great script and characters  but lately i feel as though it has turned into an emotional type of soap  if you look at promotional pictures posters of the bill now you will see either two of the officers hugging kissing or something to do with friendships whereas promotional pictures of the bill a long time ago would have shown something to do with crime  this proves that it has changed a lot from being an absolutely amazing police drama to an average type of television soap  when i watch it i feel like i m watching a police version of coronation street or something similar  i have to say i still like the bill as i m interested in police work and that type of thing but i really miss the greatness that the bill used to have  i want to rate it as 2 out of ten because you have to admit it has been totally ruined by the people who took the bill over as for the script and characters they have both gone downhill  most of the great characters are gone now  although a few still remain i think  and i m not_saying that the newer characters are poor or anything because they definitely aren t  its just that they lack the tough looks  personalities and script lines that all of the old characters used to have because most of the new ones are at the moment involved with silly relationships and family trouble overall being one of the only police programs on television these days  the bill will always be a crappily interesting thing to watch  but like i say it has lost a lot of its uniqueness  if thats the right spelling  and would now be classed as a terrible  unreal television soap recommended to watch for a good laugh over the stupidity of the police officers involved   2 10,0,1,0.5157117007120596

i wasn t entirely sure what to expect from a comedy  drama  fantasy  sci fi genre  but  given the actors involved i thought i d give it a spin  the tone of the film felt awkward  going through patches of each of the genres but not_quite felt balanced  so eventually i gave up trying  and concentrated on the cinematography and individual performances  which i thought were good on the whole  considering each character had little depth because of the nature of the story  won t give anything away here   i have to say it felt a lot longer than its 96 minute runtime  and not_in a good way  in the end i was looking for closure  some measure of satisfaction but it didn t turn out to be the clever or ingenious piece i had hoped it would be  i think tony mistakenly thought what he did do at the end of the film gave us that    but it was a tragic mistake to try and validate the previous 95 minutes with the ill conceived conclusion  ultimately i feel cheated  imo it would have been better to let it stand without the  ending  as a piece of art    just  or    i may have missed the point completely,0,1,0.3781287641054398

two years ago at sundance i loved josh kornbluth s directing debut haiku tunnel  so i was looking forward to his brother  and frequent collaborator  jacob s  the best thief in the world  this is a drama about a seemingly good kid growing up in a lower class area of new york  the movie is not_without its poignant moments  but at times it is as if kornbluth is working way too hard to state the obvious  life can be very difficult for some people  and life isn t fair more subtle  and more important  is our understanding that despite all of these somewhat abhorrent cultural underpinnings and the anti social behavior they may spawn  these characters have not_shortage of goodness and humanity  we can recoil at their language and their living conditions  but we are cannot discount their intent  and in fact  their struggles to maintain a family under such adversity has a certain nobility that most of us can barely appreciate  kornbluth grew up in this neighborhood  and his compassion for the people is evident throughout having said all this  the best thief in the world suffers from many painful flaws  including the title   the characters aren t very believable  the writing is uneven  and the plot line is barely discernible  and for many the most disturbing is that kornbluth uses two young black boys mimicking gangsta rap between scenes  to each his own  but while i don t question the potential realism of this phenomenon  it pains me to see 5 year old children mf ing and talking about having sex with a line up of women  it s unnecessary shock value and is a forced bit of borrowed interest,0,1,0.6354699956164633

what starts out as a gentle country yarn  inoffensive and mildly enjoyable romantic tale changes pace as edward norton s initially charming harlan gradually reveals more about himself and things take a turn for the sinister  as the film gradually changes from a southern romance to a modern wild western an amiable rancher  norton  wanders into town and charms a young girl  evan rachel wood   seemingly rescuing her from a dead end existence with her bad tempered father with a whirlwind romance  but it gradually becomes apparent that there is more to this cowboy than meets the eye edward norton   a real chameleon actor  with changing facial hair to match  playing a country hick  accent slightly dodgy but maybe because he s merely trying to act the part without worrying about the accent  he certainly makes it appear effortless to make all the nuanced little adjustments as we learn more about harlan  however  with too many small changes it means we are not_sure exactly where harlan is coming from  and what seemed like a good performance from norton gradually becomes confused  evan rachel wood is likable without ever really having a great deal to do other than bat her eyelids at norton down in the valley strikes as a slightly uneven tale due to its change of pace  and by not_making the protagonist s motives clear the audience s sympathies for the characters remain uncertain  should we like this drifter or not_even after a dramatic turn of events it remains unclear  this ambiguity is to the film s detriment  as if the writer could not_make up their mind what kind of story they wanted to tell and settled for somewhat of a hotch potch  had the film remained one or the other it might have been a solid film  but as it is what we are left with is something of a mess  fans of old fashioned romance will enjoy a portion of the film but will be put off by the darkening tone  completist fans of norton aside  or fans of the lush scenery of the san fernando valley   give this a miss,0,1,0.6855767659846893

i was sooooo excited to see this movie after finally reading the book this week  my 13 year old son was looking forward to it too  i rented it and snuggled down to enjoy a classic holiday story brought to life on screen boy  was i disappointed  this movie veered off from the book more times than is forgivable  george c  scott is an excellent actor but in this  it seemed that he was fully into character only about 20  of the time  the rest of the time he was quite flat i realize that this was made in  84  pre cg effects  for the most part  but it looked to be very b movie quality  especially the encounter with jacob marley the biggest disappointment was the fact that they left out one of the most moving parts of the story  when the spirit of christmas present takes scrooge on the whirlwind tour of the world  observing people in the bleakest of circumstances still having the light and love of christmastime i will admit that mr  scott did a good job with the  reformed  scrooge at the end  that was a refreshing portrayal i wish that bob cratchit had been portrayed as a little more ragged and down trodden  and tiny tim    oh don t even get me started on bad child actors,0,1,0.5865239987972932
perhaps because i was so young  innocent and brainwashed when i saw it  this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me  i haven t seen it since i was in seventh grade at a presbyterian school  so i am not_sure what effect it would have on me now  however  i will say that it left an impression on me    and most of my friends  it did serve its purpose  at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions  i was particularly terrified of what the newly converted post rapture christians had to endure when not_receiving the mark of the beast  i don t want to spoil the movie for those who haven t seen it so i will not_mention details of the scenes  but i can still picture them in my head    and it s been 19 years,0,1,0.672797162059841
i cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie  the 1972 movie with mcqueen and mcgraw is almost a classic  steve mcqueen was an outstanding actor and baldwin is only an inadequate actor  he has not_passion in his play also the action in the original  getaway  was fantastic  but the remake has not_action  it is almost boring despite the fact that the film making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994  i don t understand the way that baldwin imprisoned from mexico  i think this is a mistake in the story so i think that there was not_need to remake it  or if they decided to remake a classic  they must choose an excellent actor for the first role  like johnny depp or brad pitt,0,1,0.47004495237551686
sarah silverman is really the  flavor of the month  comic right now  is she really worth all the hype  yes and not_she is funny at times  sometimes hilariously so  her standup routine is actually quite interesting  though not_always funny   other times  you re feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer  she is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to  saying that they dig her intelligence and wit  but if you corner them  most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her  and that s why they watch her  she reminds me of why many men flocked to margaret cho and janeane garofalo  even though neither of them are really  hot  now in terms of popularity  sarah doesn t drink or smoke  at least cigs   so she should be hot when she s 60  so her fans  especially the male ones  can rejoice as for this show  it s very much like her comedy  when it works  it s hilarious  when it doesn t  it s full blown tedium and very  very boring  the aids episode here is the best one  it s consistently funny  and has some really good satire in it  brian poeshn s character has an unhealthy obsession with tab in one episode  and it s hilarious seeing him in a tab t shirt  but they not_go anywhere with it  and it eventually wears out its welcome  sarah s character in the series is rather annoying  the gay couple  brian poeshn and some other guy  seems tacked on and not_does anything for the show as a whole  and the supporting players  including sarah s real life sister  laura  who doesn t look a thing like her  are ok  when the jokes hit  they re brilliant  when they don t  they re awful  and i mean really awful  there s also an obsession with coprophilia here  aka poop jokes   which seems to have replaced actual wit and intelligence in comedy today  so should you watch this show  if you have a crush on sarah  go for it  you can gaze at her and pretend she s yours  as for her show  it s ranges from good to absolute zero,0,1,0.6721024523906165

robert altman s downbeat  new fangled western from edmund naughton s book  mccabe  was overlooked at the time of its release but in the past years has garnered a sterling critical following  aside from a completely convincing boom town scenario  the characters here don t merit much interest  and the picture looks  intentionally  brackish and unappealing  bearded warren beatty plays a turn of the century entrepreneur who settles in struggling community on the outskirts of nowhere and helps organize the first brothel  once the profits start coming in  beatty is naturally menaced by city toughs who want part of the action  altman creates a solemn  wintry atmosphere for the movie which gives the audience a certain sense of time and place  but the action in this sorry little town is limited  most of the story being made up of vignettes  and altman s pacing is deliberately slow  there s hardly a statement being made  just the opposite  in fact  and the languid actors stare at each other without much on their minds  it s a self defeating picture  and yet  in an altman quirky way  it wears defeat proudly     from,0,1,0.6059002608135142

although the lead actress is strikingly beautiful  the plot stands little chance of acceptance because too many distracting details face the audience during the unfolding of the story one may believe that middle class teen age school girls in the 1950 s easily gave away their virginity without thought of marriage to 30 year old s they barely know  but i doubt it one may believe that young high school teens are highly self confident and self assured as they interact with their elders in complex social situations  but my experience has been  more often than not_teenagers feel very awkward and act clumsy as they experiment in the adult world one may believe that a experienced medical doctor would not_know the pungent oder of stroptomycin    the smelly fermenting byproduct of busy earth microbes    and not_detect that some lifeless bland powder is fake  but i think not_one may believe that 30 something year old troublemakers can enter into  and hang around inside  a public school rec hall during a school social and make trouble  but i think that school socials are traditionally a protected environment and parents  chaparones and school staff would be around to prevent this one final nit  throughout hey babu riba the five teenage friends referred to themselves as the foursome  there is probably an explanation why the five were the foursome  but because it was not_detailed  each reference distracts from each scene this movie did not_ring true for me,0,1,0.5517449916626498

family moves away from upstate new york to berlin  bang  it is 1938  the boy is a married man in berlin and a theater playwright  what kind of plays does he write  in what language  is he successful  his wife is an actress and looks glamorous  the parents move back to the usa and invite their son to do the same  he does not_why  because having grown up in germany he feels more german than american  because he is successful  because his wife is  because he likes his life there  because he likes the nazis  because he is just plain lazy and doesn t like change  don t ask me possibly  the man just does not_care  is not_interested in politics  is a kind of an existentialist  he states that he is deeply in love with his wife  he speaks of his republic of two  meaning he and his wife   there is little to not_evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie  it much more seems a republic of one on the request of an american agent campbell  jr   agrees to broadcast anti semitic nazi hate propaganda to american listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to american authorities who read between the lines  the crucial meeting with the agent on a berlin park bench is short  unexciting and anti climactic  the decision to play along comes pretty easily with not_explanation  the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fast so now we have campbell  jr   presenting himself over the air as the last free american  the scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting   although one wonders what happened when campbell  jr   really and honestly had to cough  hiccup etc   must have scrambled the messages terribly   anyway  the nazis lose  the wife dies  touring in the crimean for german troops   i not_heard such tours really happened on german front lines in ww ii   campbell  jr   says he goes to the russian front but does not_go  is captured by an american soldier who recognizes his mug  how come    is dragged to a sight seeing tour in auschwitz  is then released and resettled with the help of the crucial agent somewhere in the city of new york and this is where the story really starts bang  from now on it is like a short story by paul auster  it is 1961  campbell  jr   lives in new york tenement as a has been and mourns the loss of his wife  nobody really cares   or do they  yes  somehow they do  and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction  auschwitz survivors  a painter  some american supremacists  discover  him and want him to be their figurehead  they even find his presumed dead wife for him  or is she his wife  anyway  in the end campbell  jr   calls in at the israeli consulate  and they obligingly give him the big war criminal treatment  placing him in the cell adjacent to adolf eichmann s  he writes his life story and  once this task finished  hangs himself on the typewriter s ribbons without getting sooty the least bit while i can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss  i just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone  so i found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss  amazingly  many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero  having put his reputation at stake for playing the last free american  i assume according to them this took a lot of courage  as a matter of fact  however  the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment campbell created for himself a win win situation  as he would have been politically on the safe side not_matter who had won the war  the danger of his being uncovered not_comes up during the first part of the story one might argue  that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything  but even then it fails to make a point  primarily  i suspect  because the love affair in the republic of two falls completely flat  this is a pity  especially if you consider that the wife was played by sheryl lee  a talented  versatile and sensuous actress  she has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous german accent  another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts  confession  broadcast and hidden messages   but i guess this is largely unfilmable  maybe i should give the book a chance,0,1,0.37270130921867073

yes  this movie has kids going to space camp and it starts out okay enough as you have the kids meeting one another and learning the ropes  then they introduce jinx  a robot that could not_exist in 1986 as they do not_have anything with that kind of artificial intelligence now  kid becomes buddy with robot and robot repays the kid s kindness by shooting him and a group of other kids in this camp into outer space with a very limited oxygen supply and radios that do not_have the signal to reach into space  this camp is also not_very fun as these kids are put to real training and the instructors get all over them for failing missions or not_doing the right things  give it a rest  they are there for fun  not_to become astronauts just yet  just give them the experience of space flight not_a military like camp  however  you do get to see joaquin phoenix in a fairly early role  so in the end a movie that tries to be realistic in some areas  but with the introduction of jinx and other factors you might as well had the kids battle space aliens on top of everything else that was happening in the movie as that would have made the movie a bit more enjoyable at least for me  probably for a few others as well  who else would like to see kate capshaw s face ripped apart by some strange super alien creature,0,1,0.5234944147335036

a film about the harlem renaissance and one author in particular  it contrasts it with a modern day story about a young  gay  black artist if that sounds vague it s because the movie itself is  it s well directed  fairly well written and  for the most part  well acted  also the scenes in the past are shot in moody black   white  also this is one of the few film dealing with gay men that does not_shy away from sex scenes  not_that explicit and not_frontal   still  i mostly hated this the film meanders all over the place  is full of unlikable characters  including the main protagonist  and  this is the killer  moves at a snails pace  three times i considered leaving the theatre because i was so utterly bored  but the director was there so i stayed  his talk afterwords shows this was a labor of love and took 6 years to complete  i really wish i could like this more  there are very few films dealing honestly with gay blacks  but i can t  unless you re very interested in the harlem renaissance there s not_reason to see this,0,1,0.40337094942446383

this film is just a shame  orlando  florida seems to becoming a more recognized filmmaking area  like vancouver s rise to prominance   the brothers was shot in central florida and this short film is a bit of a setback for the area  which made great strides with the indie film walking across africa and the great hbo miniseries from earth to the moon  i will try to be as honest as possible  i think orlando was the perfect place to film the brothers  it had the potential to give a new spin on the  boy band  craze  after all  both n sync and the backstreet boys come from this area  but  the brothers falls short probably because of a weak script  both lead characters are flat with almost not_development  part of this could be the amatuer actors  but some of it is certainly the way the script was written  also a problem is the choice of jokes  many of the jokes are too repetitive  they do come off funny the first time  but it does grow to be a bit boring   some of the  concert  scenes are staged poorly  and many of these scenes also don t seem to move the story along in any way  i had high hopes for this one  but alas its a disappointing effort  i also hope the best for the upcoming feature based on this short  but i think the best thing for filmmaker john figg is to move to different genres  quickly   comedy isn t his strong suit  but  its indisputable that he definitely is one of the more prominant filmmakers in the orlando area  its just a shame that right now he s infamous  not_famous,0,1,0.4466307117255702

saving grace is surely one of the leading contenders for the  how to ruin an adequate film in the final few minutes  award  naturally if you mix a quaint cornish village   largely populated by retired genteel ladies   with a liberal dose of marijuana  a certain amount of silliness will ensue  however  the last seven minutes of the film descend into the totally ludicrous and is not_even redeemed by being particularly funny  it is a real shame  because this comedy has the potential to be every bit as good as 1998 s waking ned devine  which also portrayed a picturesque small village and its oddball inhabitants trying to extract themselves from a tricky situation the protagonist of saving grace is middle aged  recently widowed grace trevethyn  whose husband s legacy of bad debts has forced her into an unconventional way of earning money  helped by her gardener  matthew  she turns her horticultural expertise to the lucrative cultivation of marijuana  unfortunately  this leads her into confrontation with the local police  her husband s creditors and a french drug baron                    whom all turn up at her greenhouse simultaneously  the relationship and rapport between grace and matthew is well portrayed  and brenda blethyn gets the viewer emotionally involved with her likeable character   you can really feel what she is going through the casting of the minor roles is excellent  even if some of them are rather outlandishly eccentric  however  the transformation of jacques the drug lord into grace s romantic interest is highly implausible and does not_fit the tone of the movie at all  and surely hydroponics is not_such a revolution in the world of cannabis growing  sadly the film swaps gentle humour for slapstick and ends up being as fake as the marijuana plants,0,1,0.5316807976592989

this film is really something of a curate s egg  good in parts  in contrast to other reviewers  i found that the main fault with it is its inability to draw in the viewer s interest in the characters and the plot  i sat through it because i m interested in rock n roll and the dynamics of bands  but if i were to evaluate it purely on the basis of its merit as a movie  i would have to give it the thumbs down  with a few caveats  jason behr is good in the part of john livien  and quite convincing as a rock singer  the narrative regarding his childhood trauma is unclear  although we are given hints in livien s well acted relationship to his parents  but his behaviour is ultimately bizarre to the viewer  which it shouldn t be   nevertheless the idea of using a stage persona to solve inner conflicts is interesting  albeit not_novel nor fully explored as a theme in this film  the allusions to john lennon were irritating  but i confess i m not_a beatles fan  at any rate  livien and his band reminded me more of oasis than the beatles  in the sense that there was something derivative about them  another frustrating thing about the movie was the way it opened up with some interesting   albeit middlebrow and high school level   philosophical musings of the lead character  but left the threads of his thinking there  only to pick them up again in the middle of the film very briefly  when livien says   before god  there was music   ever seen that ad for tia maria in the 1990s   before time  there was tia maria   that s what sprung to mind anyway   it seems an idiotic conclusion  and the viewer has not_idea how he reached it  but he s entitled to it  fortunately his bassist and friend  played ably by dominic monaghan  seems to acknowledge the fallacy of this thinking when he responds  you don t know that  in all  the limited strengths of the direction and the plot could go either way on future projects  into pointless banality or into an interesting and more mature perspective,0,1,0.45274288797953405

man  i really wanted to like these shows  i am starving for some good television and i applaud tnt for providing these  opportunites   but  sadly  i am in the minority i guess when it comes to the cinematic stephen king  as brilliant as king s writing is  the irony is that it simply doesn t translate well to the screen  big or small  with few exceptions  very few   the king experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read  many people would disagree with this  but i m sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed king story is but a pale memory of the one they read  the reason is simple  the average king story takes place in the mind scape of the characters in the story  he gives us glimpses of their inner thoughts  their emotions and their sometimes fractured or unreal points of view  in short  king takes the reader places where you can t put a panavision camera  as an audience watching the filmed king  we re left with less than half the information than the reader has access to  it s not_too far a stretch to claim that one becomes a character in a king story they read  whereas one is limited to petty voyeurism of that same character when filmed  for as long as king writes  hollywood will try shooting everything that comes out of his word processor  without any regard to whether or not_they should  i don t blame the filmmakers for trying  but it takes an incredible amount of talent and circumspection to pull off the elusive stephen king adaptation that works  the task is akin to turning lead into gold  or some arcane zen mastery  oh well  better luck next time,0,1,0.5126473911393282

various spoilers follow gene kelly  not_georges guetary  who is sometimes criticized for being too young and un french  not_leslie caron  who is sometimes criticized for her very green performance  not_even oscar levant  who more often than not_annoys the dickens out of me not_it would definitely be gene kelly  there s something about his screen persona that s too ambitious and focused for him to be convincing as a penniless artist in paris  content to put off facing the critics indefinitely  frolicking with little kids and old ladies and painting in the streets  that s what made him so effective in singin  in the rain and other movies where he played ambitious  focused characters  jerry mulligan is in some ways a cousin to tommy albright in brigadoon  another lerner story with kelly miscast as an american at loose ends who falls in love with a picturesque european place and an innocent female who embodies its virtues except that jerry isn t as likeable as even poor dazed tommy  that s another galling thing about this film  jerry is sometimes a cad to milo  and even worse to lise  when he first sees the latter at a club  he pulls a dirty trick to get her to dance with him  when she sits down again he pulls an even dirtier trick to get her phone number  when he calls her the next day she hangs up on him  which he takes as a cue to drop in at her workplace  and throughout all this it s obvious she wants nothing to do with him  when she starts laughing at his jokes in the perfume shop  it s about as believable as milo s interest in his paintings  sure he s good looking and playful  but why should that sway her when she s got henri  who seems like a gentleman to boot admittedly it comes off so distasteful partly because of the actress  if a role like lise was played by  say  judy garland  she would shower jerry with indignant insults and glares  if she was played by cyd charisse  one would admire his guts  but when she s played by first timer leslie caron she looks and acts like a shy  vulnerable teenager  and as a result jerry just seems like a creep  and why did they choose these other actors  though personally i d rather they d solved things by changing the lead  when the whole story hinges on the romance of these two young poor sweethearts disentangling themselves from their loveless commitments to older rich people  not_is gene kelly a few years above guetary and foch  he s old enough to be caron s father in short i think it all would have been improved by casting some young comedic relief type dancer as jerry  the kind that usually turned up in musical supporting roles   e g  ray macdonald in good news or bobby van in small town girl  maybe not_them necessarily but someone like them  someone who could have chased lise and made it seem harmlessly playful  someone who would have appeared genuinely happy living in that chaplinesque hole in the wall  someone whose humor and naivete would have contrasted better with oscar levant s sarcastic grumpiness  it probably also would have made the ballet seem less ponderous  and it might have provided a voice that could sing gershwin better all this may give the impression that i don t like gene kelly  i do like him  he was terrific in most of his films  just not_this one  well  and a few others   i don t despise aaip itself  either  it has good points  like the art direction  and leslie caron  who despite her inexperience is rather charming  and really does look like she just stepped out of a painting  georges guetary does a fine job and his  stairway to paradise  is my favorite number in the movie  nina foch is beautiful and touching and should have ended up with somebody  but not_jerry mulligan  i wouldn t wish that on her,0,1,0.8246254421153298
i remember the days in which kim basinger was nothing more than a pretty face who adorned movies with typical characters of dumb blondie romantic interest or damsel in danger but everything changed when she won an academy award as best supporting actress for her role in the excellent movie l a  confidential and i think i was not_the only one who was surprised by her solid performance however after that moment her career did not_follow the ideal path sure the prestige she won thanks to that movie made her to participate on moderately prestigious movies  like people i know or the door in the floor  but we have not_seen her again on a substantial character the movie while she was out does nothing to put her on that situation  and it is not_that her character is not_too tasty but also that the movie is really crappy the screenplay from this movie could not_be more hollow and basic however basinger brings some conviction to her character and that makes this poor movie to win a few points this movie is full of clichés and generic villains the work of director susan montford is truly disastrous for many reasons but mainly because the movie not_gets a good rhythm and tone the ending from this movie is extremely ridiculous i do not_recommend while she was out at all this film commits the capital sin of being boring,0,1,0.538116142730722
scary movie 3 isn t as funny as its predecessors but its still has its funny moments  it all begins when roving reporter cindy campbell sets out to find a hard news story in the middle of television sweeps  she soon uncovers an outrageous onslaught of globe threatening developments including alien invaders  killer videotapes  freaky crop circles and much more  faced with conspiracies of massive proportions  and a crew of very strange people following her around  cindy must fight to stop evil from taking over the world yet again  the plot is a non issue here as the first two were pretty much plot less  this time around they focus on signs  the ring  matrix reloaded and 8 mile as well as many others just not_as much as the previously mentioned ones  the first one was  imo  one of the funniest films i have ever seen  the second one wasn t as good but still quite funny  the third one is mildly enjoyable but its nothing special  let s just say that i didn t mind seeing it once but i probably wouldn t want to see it again  the jokes are either hit or miss and the ones that are funny usually involve charlie sheen  the lame ones usually involve anthony anderson as he is very overrated  why he keeps getting cast is unclear because he isn t funny  anna faris gives a funny performance and she s also kind of underrated  simon rex shows some potential as he actually wasn t so bad  regina hall also returns as brenda and she gives a pretty funny performance  the rest of the cast were pretty much a bunch of cameos  jenny mccarthy and pamela anderson probably had the funniest scene out of all the cameos  their in the opening sequence spoofing the ring and that scene turns out to be on of the more enjoyable ones in the film  denise richards  queen latifah  camryn manheim and many others also have cameos  david zucker directs and while this isn t another airplane  it s also not_another my boss s daughter either  its pointless to really analyze a straight comedy as the main thing that people want to know if its funny or not_like i said before if you do like it  you probably won t really like it that much  in the end  i found it a bit disappointing as the pg 13 rating kind of weaken it but it can still be enjoyed  rating 6 3 10,0,1,0.5495863131310019

anything that might have been potentially interesting in this material is sunk in the first few seconds with a disclaimer that the events we re about to see can t ever be known and  this is the whisper  rumor  most often told  about one of hollywood s most sensational  mysteries  okay  so we re not_getting anything new  and e  s  mysteries   scandals  gives you a better foothold on the particular incident   and that s not_much of an endorsement   what do we get we learn that hollywood is a nest of viper s and decadents  not_big news there  more interesting we learn what a washed up director is willing to do to regain his position of power in the entertainment industry and or political establishment  it raises the question of whether peter bogdanovich is speaking from his own experience through these characters  but what s told is so cynical and ugly and muddled  we re left feeling guilty for witnessing a bunch of hooey that passes itself off as history the tone of the film has a curious madcap quality that i found more irritating than fun  we re not_empathetic with anyone  and the great  citizen kane  polishes off the relationship between davies and hearts in a much more convincing way  in  the cat s meow  we re not_ever sure of davies motives for being with hearst  as soon as we re told one thing  she s off doing the other and are we to believe that davies was the love of chaplain s life  or is he just trying to cockold one of america s most powerful  and apparently moronic  citizens  the film not_makes it clear what is convincing are the production values  there s a glorious recreation of the yacht and period costumes  i got more out of looking at the construction of some of the lapels on the men s jackets than following a story that libels many of the the most well known personalities in hollywood history  not_one will remember that the screenplay is pure fiction  the disclaimers that frame the film only make it all the more tentative and unsatisfying the performers can t be faulted  although meg tilly goes way past parody here  kirsten dunst not_disappoints  she gives the most sincere performance in a sea of scenery chewing  only joanna lumley rises above the material  but so much so that she seems to be distancing herself from the whole enterprise rather than narrating it  one of her first lines is   i m not_here   and i m sure she wishes she wasn t this isn t on par with bogdanovich s trashy  so bad it s good  at long last love   it s perched on attempting something serious  but hesitates and stumbles chiefly because it s so full of bitterness towards  the beast  named hollywood  this is  national enquirer  filmmaking  and it not_soils the names of those who the film places on board the oneida that weekend  but the audience gets pretty dirty as well,0,1,0.5032393720178825

it was almost unfathomable to me that this film would be a bust but i was indeed disappointed  having been a connoisseur of pekinpah cinema for years  i found this dvd  drastically reduced  for sale and thought it was worth a shot  the opening few credits  iconic to pekinpah fans  has the inter cutting between man and animal  but here we have non diegetic ambient noise of children playing in a schoolyard while a bomb is being planted  fantastic suspense  then  when the perps  caan and duval  travel to their next mission  duval drops the bomb on cann that his date last night had an std  found only by snooping through her purse while cann was being intimate with her  the ensuing laughter is fantastic  and is clearly paid homage to in brian depalma s dressed to kill  at the short lived expense of angle dickenson  the problem with the killer elite is that after the opening credits  the film falls flat  even bring me the head of alfredo garcia has stronger production value  a bold call for anyone who knows what i m talking about  i use pekinpah s credits as supplementary lecture material  but once they are finished  turn the killer elite off,0,1,0.37684516345034136
i realize that living in the western plains of wyoming during the 1900s was brutal  in fact  it probably is still brutal today  but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly  made for tv  movie  also  women s rights were still budding in this nation during this time  so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory  and still show the realism of the era  would it make for good viewing  honestly  i don t know  i have thought about this film for the past two days  and i still can t seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film  yet i can truthfully tell you that it wasn t the greatest i have ever seen  from several hodgepodge styles of acting  to two mismatched actors playing devoid of emotion character  to some of the most gruesome pg rated scenes to ever come out of late 70s cinema  it is hard to fully get a good grasp on heartland  was it good  was it bad  that may be up for you to view and decide yourself  but until then  here are moments i enjoyed and desperately hated  this film continues to be a struggle in my mind because there were some very interesting scenes  scenes where i wasn t sure what the director was doing or which direction he was headed  but somehow still seemed to work well as a whole  i thought the story as a whole was a very interesting  historical tale  i do not_know much about living in wyoming  especially during the early 1900s  so this film captured that image in my mind  the thought of very cold winters  not_neighbors for miles upon miles  and this polaroid esquire view untouched by corporate america  it was refreshing to witness and sheer breathtaking to experience  though the television   there were scenes that really stood out in my mind  like the cattle branding scene  the pig slaughtering scene  and the saddening homesteader that didn t survive their journey  that just brought a true sense of realism to this story  director richard pearce did a great job of bringing the view of wyoming to the viewers  but i am not_sure he brought decent players to accompany the view while i will constantly compliment the scenery of this film  i had trouble coping with the actors that seemingly walked on the set and read their lines from cards on the side  rip torn seemed out of place in his role as clyde stewart  a loner that somehow finds a connection with conchata ferrell s elinore randall  the two as actors have not_chemistry at all  their scenes that they share together are pointless and honestly void of any emotion  the pregnancy scene nearly had me in stitches because of the way these two  veteran  actors portrayed it  the brave elinore does what she has to do to get the child out of her  while clyde gives an approving nod when she is done  this is love  was it supposed to be love  i don t know  i think with stronger characters we would have seen a stronger bond  but with torn and ferrell  it felt like two actors just playing their parts  other scenes that just seemed to struggle in my mind were ones like when the frozen horse  knocks  on the door for food or shelter  the constantly fading and growing compassion that clyde had for elinore s daughter  i just didn t believe it   the lack of true winter struggle  and the entire land scene  the land scene especially because i needed more explanation on what elinore was doing  why she was doing it  and why clyde would build her a house if they were married  it was these simple events that if taken the time to explore  would have made for a stronger film overall  i will go middle of the road with this feature  there were definitely elements that should have been explored deeper  such as the relationship between these two strangers and the ultimate homesteading goals of elinore  but they were countered with some beautiful scenes of our nation  these panoramic scenes which  in the span of 100 years  have changes from vast mountains to enormous skyscrapers  while there were some brilliant scenes of realism  starring cattle and pigs   i just felt as if we needed more  depth was a key element lacking in this film  which was overshadowed by marginal acting and a diminishing story  pearce could have dove deeper into this untapped world  but instead left open loopholes and clichéd western characters  ferrell carried her own  but torn was completely miscast  decent for a viewing  but will not_be picked up again by me grade     out of,0,1,0.7452213446120567

this film is pure  hollywood hokum   it is based upon a novel called  not_too narrow  not_too deep  by richard sale  which may or may not_have been interesting  it would take research to find out  the story in the film takes for granted many incidents and much background which obviously existed in the novel but are nowhere to be seen in the film  so either the film was savagely cut or the screenplay was a mess from the start  there is not_one millisecond in this film which is remotely realistic  either in terms of events or characters  it is pure hollywood fantasy in every respect  two well known actors  paul lukas and peter lorre  are so under used and wasted that there was not_point in their being in the film at all  they must have been thrown into the mix in the manner in which one adds a sprinkling of chopped chives to an omelette  hoping that the flavour will be enhanced  the film is a ponderous attempt at producing a  morality tale   and is so corny that it is laughable  the story concerns some hardened criminals imprisoned in french guiana who want to escape from their french colonial prison through a jungle  very much a hollywood set jungle  with a rubber snake   naturally there has to be a woman in the story  so joan crawford hams it up as a down on her luck tramp who for some reason becomes irresistible to clark gable  one of the escaped criminals  crawford in escaping through the jungle wears high heeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh  gable flirts and grimaces and makes mawkish expressions  crinkling his brow as was his wont  smirking and looking suggestively at everybody  which was his manner of acting  it is hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal when he is always trying so hard to be clark gable that surely he hasn t any time left to be a thief   attention seekers are by definition too busy to steal and unsuited to a task which requires that people not_see them   the whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be regarded as light entertainment  an attempt at religiosity and  depth  is made by injecting into the story a mysterious  angel of mercy  who voluntarily walks into the prison and pretends to be an inmate  he helps in the escape and accompanies all the criminals and ministers to their various deaths  helping them to find  peace  in their last gasps  this character is played very well by ian hunter  who retains throughout a convincing air of secret knowledge  smiles enigmatically  makes cryptic prophetic remarks  and has a small spot trained on his face to give him a heavenly glow  the theme is meant to be redemption  you might call it the donald duck version of  hollywood goes moral and gets heavy   for real depth  hitchcock s  i confess  of 1953 shows how it should really be done  by contrast  this piece of trivial nonsense shows just how bare the cupboards of meaning were in tinsel town  and that when they went rummaging for something that might mean something  all they could come up with was  you guessed it  more tinsel,0,1,0.5847708072837963

since most review s of this film are of screening s seen decade s ago i d like to add a more recent one  the film open s with stock footage of b 17 s bombing germany  the film cut s to oskar werner s hauptmann  captain  wust character and his aide running for cover while making their way to hitler s fuehrer bunker  once inside  they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel  the film then cut s to one of many conference scene s with albin skoda giving a decent impression of adolf hitler rallying his officer s to  ultimate victory  while werner s character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizen s are caught up in a fantasy world some non bunker event s are depicted  most notable being the flooding of the subway system to prevent a russian advance through them and a minor subplot involving a young member of the flak unit s and his family s difficulty in surviving this film suffer s from a number of detail inaccuracies that a german film made only 10 year s after ww2 should not_have included  the actor portraying goebbels  willy krause  wear s the same uniform as hitler  including arm eagle  goebbels wore a brown nazi party uniform with swastika armband the  ss  soldier s wear german army camouflage  the well documented scene of hitler awarding the iron cross to boy s of the hitler youth is shown as having taken place inside the bunker  it was done outside in the courtyard  and lastly  hitler s suicide weapon is clearly shown as a belgian browning model 1922 most account s agree it was a walther ppk some bit s of acting also seem wholly inaccurate with the drunken dance scene near the end of the film being notable  this bit is shown as a cabaret skit  with a intoxicated wounded soldier  his arm in a splint  maniacally goose stepping to music while a nurse does a combination striptease belly dance  all by candlelight    this is actually embarrassing to watch the most incredible bit is when werner s captain wust gain s an audience alone with skoda s hitler  hitler is shown as slumped on a wall bench  drugged and delirious  when werner s character begin s to question him  hitler start s screaming which bring s in a ss guard who mortally wound s werner s character in the back with a gunshot this fabricated scene is not_based on any true historic account werner s character is then hauled off to die in a anteroom while hitler prepare s his own ending  hitler s farewell to his staff is shown but the suicide is off screen  the final second s of the movie show hitler s funeral pyre smoke slowly forming into a ghostly image of the face of the dead oskar werner hauptmann wust this film is more allegorical than historical and anyone interested in this period would do better to check out more recent film s such as the 1973 remake  hitler  the last 10 day s  or the german film  downfall   der untergang  if they wish a more true accounting of this dramatic story  these last two film s are based on first person eyewitness account s  with  hitler  the last 10 day s  being compiled from gerhard boldt s autobiography as a staff officer in the fuehrer bunker and  downfall  being done from hitler s secretary s recollection s  the screen play for  der letzte akte  is taken from american nuremberg war crime s trial judge michael musmanno s book  ten day s to die   which is more a compilation of event s  many obviously fanciful  than eyewitness history it is surprising that hugh trevor roper s account  the last day s of hitler  was not_made into a film,0,1,0.659820261715458
be warned  neither zeta jones nor mcgregor plays the main part as the poster would have you believe  their roles are in fact minor the film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama  with neither being really engaging  especially i find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist  not_to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancé  the plot drags terribly  and i turned this one off after about 2 3   unusual for me  as i like to finish what i start  the good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 stars 2 10,0,1,0.5344403075846035
the one reason i remember this is that it was shown the week after nigel kneale s brilliant quatermass serial was broadcast   the trailers made heavy emphasis that the main character had a mutilated arm which had me hoping he d be like victor caroon from the quatermass experiment stalking the streets of london  not_such luck because the racing game is just a rather drab thriller with the gimmick of having a hero with a physical disability trying to get to the bottom of investigations of corrupt horse racing   i suppose if you re a fan of dick francis you might enjoy it but setting it in the context of the late 70s when the sweeney had just finished and the professionals was still being produced   there s something lacking about the racing game   one trailer featured a car over taking another on a motor way   if it d been a trailer for the sweeney you d see jack regan over taking a car and beating a confession out of the slags who d done a blag while the professionals would have over taken a car and blown away the terrorists inside   i think that sums up what s wrong with this series,0,1,0.4320290257585438
the bank   1915  chaplin   the bank  was one of charlie s 1915 essanay films  while these group of films are more watchable than their 1914 counterparts  this one seems a bit below average  the gag with the janitorial double combo locked vault and the tough luck ending that has charlie waking up from a dream  in which he is stroking the lead lady s hair  only to be stroking the head of a mop he had used as a quasi pillow  are both classic chaplin moments  they are both ironically the beginning and the end  the middle is filled in with fighting with the rival co worker janitor and busting up a bank robbery to win the girl  the mop is probably the greatest physical prop of this movie and charlie uses it to expert comedic effect whether while it is the intention of his character or not_the mop seems to be charlie s alter ego doing things he wishes he could do but wouldn t with his own two hands  interesting stuff but there s better,0,1,0.5636457926911533
a hint i think may be gathered by the various comments on this thread i was quite amazed at the number of people who liked this film who want to make it  mandatory  or  compulsory  i think this gives us a little bit of insight into the reason this film and the issue underlying it is so polarizing the global warming issue appeals a lot to people who want to force others to  do right   it appeals particularly to more  liberal  leaning people because it doesn t have to do with bedroom morality which is what usually gets conservatives who want to force you to  be good  going and that s the problem with the film  al gore is a politician  and a very successful one at that  he just can t help himself from appealing to those people who want to force others to do as they would  the political appeal is just too great and there we are left with a scientific issue that may be of huge importance  reduced to a political issue appealing to those in the body politic with a predilection to force other to  do right  another interesting question is how did the environmental movement get hijacked by such people,0,1,0.598028802076295

i ve seen my fair share of badly thought out endings and final twists to films  but i don t recall any film that committed outright suicide like this one did the film makers were clearly hoping that the great twist would  surprise  us all     and it did  but perhaps not_in the way the directors had hoped  i was left feeling surprised that connery  harris  fishburn and capshaw had anything to do with this turkey  individually or collectively the film up until the final thirty minutes was rather engaging and i like the way the story was unfolding and the nature of the film overall  but once the twist was revealed  the plot holes and inconsistencies were remarkable  the underlying motive for revenge was ill conceived and the ways things so neatly worked out for bobby earl was ridiculously far fetched  what s worse is that  once the twist was revealed  the remainder of the film became excruciatingly predictable harris gave a terrific performance and connery is like morgan freeman in that he not_gives a bad performance  even if the movie ain t that great  so all in all  it starts well and the unfolding keeps the viewer interested  the last 30 minutes is one of the most memorable nose dives in the history of cinema,0,1,0.39355613400656936

first off  i m not_here to dog this movie  i find it totally enjoyable in spite of the poor production quality  the acting herein is about as abominable as the monster stalking them  although the monster itself is quite well done   impressively well done  at that  he actually looks kind of other worldly  like an alien family on vacation landed in the himalayas and while dad was out taking a     attending to nature s call  spot got loose and they just didn t have time to hunt him down  that  or he s the caucasian brother of the wishmaster  i haven t decided which actually  this seems to have been filmed somewhere in snow country  yes  but more likely canada somewhere than china anywhere  the trees and vistas say canada to me  and it s okay that the set area not_takes on the look or feel of uber coldness one might expect to find in the himalayas of china  it s a sci fi channel movie  so we can forgive the lack of location further  apparently  as we have just established  sci fi directors do not_travel often  as they are not_aware that commercial planes fly above weather like what is featured herein and the subsequent crash actually would not_have happened  but as i said  it s a sci fi channel movie so we must forgive a few things the movie is pretty graphic at times  and rotates between  alive  about the donner party   predator  about the alien in the woods  and any bad wushu movie where they fly about on wires  the yeti apparently can leap about like spiderman   or super mario   remember   run faster  jump higher  live longer   also  the yeti has missed his teddy bear  he s searched high and low for it  but cannot seem to make a cadaver work  poor yeti  you can t help but feel sorry for it  it has survived and evolved thousands of years only to succumb to severe teddy bear loss  he s missed his bear  or maybe it wants to mate  but that thought is banished  do ya hear me  well  it does seem to be an unmated male  rebanished  and it s superhuman  well  it s not_human   it s super yeti  but then again  what s normal yeti  i don t know  but he has a definite michael meyers quality that is completely unsettling  and he s got this fabulous way of cleaning his fur  fabulous dahlink  it s spotlessly white at times when it so shouldn t be  he s fastidiously superhu    super yeti all in all  this was a lot of fun to watch  has some great kills and a few honest plot elements  in spite of the horribly gravel like production style  this is actually quite entertaining  i can t help wondering if they re planning on another one  it rates a 6 0 10 on the m4tv scale it rates a 4 4 10 on the movie scale from   the fiend,0,1,0.5025015444726625

although i am generally a proponent of the well made film  i do not_limit myself to films which escape those boundaries  and more often than not_i do enjoy and admire films that successfully  break the rules   and it is quite true that director pasolini breaks the rules of established cinema  but it is also my opinion that he does not_break them successfully or to any actual point pasolini s work is visually jarring  but this is less a matter of what is actually on the screen than how it is filmed  and the jumpiness of his films seem less a matter of artistic choice than the result of amateur cinematography  this is true of decameron  pasolini often preferred to use non actors  and while many directors have done so with remarkable result  under pasolini s direction his non actors tend to remain non actors  this is also true of decameron  pasolini quite often includes images designed to shock  offend  or otherwise disconcert the audience  such elements can often be used with startling effect  but in pasolini s hands such elements seldom seem to actually contribute anything to the film  this is also true of decameron i have been given to understand there are many people who like  even admire pasolini s films  even so  i have not_met any of them  and i have not_been able to read anything about pasolini or his works that made the reason for such liking or admiration comprehensible to me  judging him from his works alone  i am of the opinion that he was essentially an amateurish director who did not_break the rules  so much by choice as by lack of skill  and who was initially applauded by the intelligentsia of his day for   existential boldness   thereby simply confirming him in bad habits as a film maker  i find his work tedious  unimpressive  and pretentious  and this  too  is true of decameron  it is also  sadly  true of virtually every pasolini film it has been my misfortune to endure,0,1,0.4683547659497563

so i finally saw the film  my left foot  last night after years of being told by my mother how amazing it is    the central performance of day lewis is indeed remarkable and amazing  but anyone with even minimal exposure to his other work should expect nothing less the fatal misjudgement in my eyes was that in becoming obsessed with proving the normalcy of this man  the movie chose to show him as a complete and utter jerk  on the one hand i can see that this is a logical correlation  mankind always has the capacity to be objectionable  and disability shouldn t obscure that  i just wish that impartial onlookers wouldn t be so forgiving of aberrant behaviour and assume that circumstances automatically make it forgivable  they don t  acting out is normal  and so yes  disabled people act out   but they don t do it because they re disabled  they do it because they re being unreasonable  a physical impairment doesn t afford you the right to throw a hissy fit in public  just because someone you love turns you down there are certain things it is unwise to do whether you are disabled or able bodied  giving someone tacit permission to boot a football directly at your head for the sole purpose of fitting in is one of them   admittedly  i did once save a penalty from the school s star striker with my face  but i already belonged by then  it wasn t for acceptance   engaging in a bar brawl is another  revelling in the fact that your father only extends companionship to you after you ve proved yourself capable of metaphorically jumping through physical hoops takes masochism a step too far  all of these things are stupid  and suffering through them as a way to demonstrate your bravery doesn t make them any less foolhardy so yes  just because you ve overcome obstacles to achieve great things doesn t make you any less of a jerk    being a good person takes priority  setting an inspiring example for the disabled should appear way down the list,0,1,0.5737884228278674

magnolia presents itself as a wall to wall canvas of screaming  shrieking  overwrought  hysterical twits who are all bedeviled by regret  guilt and pain  pt anderson is certainly a gifted filmmaker but perhaps he should leave the writing to someone else or at least find someone with the balls to tell him he needed to edit this overlong mess a look at the cast will tell you that the performances were excellent  and they were  i just wish that every scene didn t involve an over the top shouting match or long digression into the sins that have been committed and the pain that they have caused i also think that anderson fails miserably to create a story that parallels the bizarre tableaus that open the film  the opening sequences are wonderful in showing how fate can bring together people and circumstances that even the most optimistic believer in a cosmic puppeteer pulling our strings would scoff at  but the story that then develops lacks any of the stuff that these opening fables display  i kept waiting for some form of cosmic convergence to display itself  but instead all we get is waves of regret from morally challenged characters who see their past spread out before them and now seek absolution  throw in an out of left field biblical plague near the end and all you end up with is a cadre of anderson devotees who will marvel at his genius when all it really proves is that he has actually read the old testament i will say that the music by aimee mann was great and i ll be looking for the soundtrack cd  in short  a good movie to look at and listen to  the music  that is  if the actors would have shut up or toned it down it may have been,0,1,0.5224022125457604
raymond burr stars as an attorney caught up in the murder of his best friend  dick foran  thanks to his affection for his friend s wife  angela lansbury   this was a full year before he started doing perry mason  so the movie might be of particular interest to his fans if it was the inspiration for his casting there isn t all that much else here that s interesting though  lansbury is always good  but her character here is very one dimensional and the motives for her crime in the mystery are totally obvious  there s an interesting performance by lamont johnson as a painter who s also in love with the  femme fatale   but the burr character is pretty straightforward  it s frankly bizarre to see an actor like burr doing these romantic scenes with lansbury  and his halting delivery does not_match his character here very well as it does in most films i ve seen him in  there s not_mystery at all really  and the whole suspense is supposed to be around the title of the film and the way that burr s character is setting up the lansbury character to implicate herself  double jeopardy prevents her being tried again for the original murder  presumably   he does so with a very large tape recorder which she doesn t notice when she comes into the room i guess a few perhaps unintentionally fun moments and basically the rest of the thing could have been done for tv,0,1,0.378543331293054

absolute beginners  was a film for the younger generation  a multi time film that discussed the issues that teens were facing in britain and how these troubled  constantly hitting each note  teen s problems can relate to the youth of tomorrow  it could have been dubbed the  moulin rouge  of the 80s  but it disappeared  it made its very shallow mark on the world  snuck under the radar  and can now be found collecting dust at either the musical section  the comedy section  or the politically obscure section of that seedy video store that doesn t need chain money to survive  alas  that wasn t where i found it   but i found it  watched it  tried my hardest to sing along with it  stared into bowie s eyes  but found myself faded by the end  did it not_survive the test of time  is 1950s london too far removed from our current society  is bowie too creepy  i think  absolute beginners  falls somewhere into each of these questions as the perfect example of cinema that starts out with a bang  but withers to a mere sparkle by the end  absolute beginners  opens with a huge number that takes us through the non gritty streets of london which involve theft nightly  prostitutes on every corner  dance throughout  booze like rivers  and the swankiest ties on nearly every individual  sounds like a place we would all hate to be  right  director julien temple keeps the mood light and flashy throughout most of the songs as we attempt to learn something about a plethora of our main characters  the one we follow most is colin played by eddie o connell who follows his dreams of being a photographer while shooting his favorite girl  suzette  played by patsy kensit   these two have chemistry  and while suzette looks like a pre rehab lohan  to me they worked  there was a huge spark between them  the chemistry was like lava  and i believed that these two could take me down a road i had not_traveled  i was ready   but then  something happened  temple takes us out of the nightlife  takes us out of the city we grew up with at the beginning  and completely reverses the roles without any dedication to the first  suzette runs away  colin becomes a pervert  and bowie  well  i am not_quite sure what his role is but he sings amazingly well while climbing a mountain   i can tell you that much  temple gives us this flashy city  this opportunity to see those that inhabit it  but leaves us hanging high and dry when it is time to pull the trigger  we learn about colin  mainly  but nobody else  i could probably watch this film again and still be equally confused as to whom is angry at whom  and what importance fashion had to that era  also  were they teens really   they all seemed like they were pushing their late 20s  but maybe it was my tv character development thrown right out the door  temple tries to overcompensate by giving us bigger  more lavish songs using even more characters that we know nothing about  one of my favorite songs in the film uses this thought as a prime example  temple uses a split house to show us the lives of colin s parents  of which i didn t know it was them until after the film  and a song which screams apathy  great song  too many characters  not_enough time  suddenly dragged into another scene of missing coherency  and it just falls apart in your hands  then  if that wasn t enough  we are rocking our heads to the beat of some great songs  rubbing our noggin  trying to understand where our characters are or are going  and temple throws in hatred  anger  and politics into the final act  while i was hoping that this film would have a dedicated theme  i didn t think racism would be on the top of the bill  suddenly  friends are missing  people are angry  and there is some random guy running around fighting colin because he lives in poverty and has a friend of a different race  somebody help me out here  it seemed completely rushed and overwhelming   nearly to the point of wanting to turn the film off  to me  the ending of  absolute beginners  was nowhere near the excitement from the opening number  that first part set the pace  and temple could not_keep up overall  i must say that temple can direct a music video  but i don t think he was quite prepared for the feature film  i don t think this film will ever make it into full  cult  status  and will probably remain unremembered or in the dollar bin for years to come  it is a fun film to watch initially  but when we get to that final part  it just explodes from the inside  i wanted some cutting edge work  but instead what i found was a freaky bowie coupled with characters i cared nothing for  i could see how this film could relate to the youth of the 80s  but by the end it just felt forced  i think everyone in this production should have taken a moment and listened to  motivation  by the ever freaky bowie in this film  it may have helped solidify this feature into better cult status  i am glad that i watched this film once  but that is all that my small brain can take  i loved the way that temple caught me from the beginning  but he couldn t control his characters  way too many   and the songs didn t seem to match the final moments of the film  it came out of nowhere  and it was unwelcomed  if this was a film about racism  it needed to be from the beginning   absolute beginners  was a welcomed adventure  but i don t think i will be dusting this film off in the future grade     out of,0,1,0.7408574019044428

the hysterical thing about this movie is that  according to the director  it has difficulty finding a distributor in the u s  because most of them that viewed it couldn t reconcile the seemingly conflicting messages of christianity and american angst  the thought of anyone seeing this as a religious film in anyway is laughable because a minister at a mission prays with the homeless or wishes someone  godspeed  this makes it a  christian  movie  one could interpret that it is actually mocking religion for in the  land of plenty  with all of its material excess  the best an organized mission can do is hand out a bowl of soup and a bible verse  plenty of unfortunate or downtrodden maybe  plenty of useless homeless missions  how about plenty of psycho vietnam vets  as a pill popping delusional survivor of agent  pink  are we to think america is a  land of plenty  of paranoid patriots  maybe we have plenty of psychiatric patients  certainly we don t have plenty of people concerned about palestine politics based on the main characters phone conversation in the film  of course if you worked in a german homeless shelter the unfortunate there would be much more concerned about peace in a distant land than their own personal survival as the world knows how europe is the  continent of plenty  when it comes to sophistication indeed i agreed with the title in the end as the united states is the  land of plenty  and in this particular case it refers to the abundance of poor scripts  amateur acting and dispassionately directed films  life is too short and one  even an american  doesn t have  plenty  of time to waste watching this piece,0,1,0.4430246804808657

the fifth  black emanuelle  i ve watched has  potentially  the most intriguing plot line dealing as it does with the intrepid female reporter investigating the white slavery prostitution racket which takes her from san francisco to rome to macao and back to her own hometown  new york  the film is peopled with past veterans of the series which  inexplicably  play completely different roles  namely ivan rassimov  appearing here as a head of a united nations committee for third world countries    karin shubert  as a feminist rival reporter  and don powell  as rassimov s chauffeur  unfortunately  as usual with this type of film  despite their being shown in the dead of night   it is heavily edited and a particularly graphic scene  described in  stracultr  in which an asian slave trader gets his comeuppance by being sodomized by a dog is nowhere to be seen here   still  a harrowing sequence late in the film when a sleazy politician tricks a couple of girls  including  naturally  gemser and shubert  into a midnight rendezvous under a new york bridge with a group of bums  this is the way he gets their votes  get it     with his high society pals giddily looking on   seems pretty much intact the most ridiculous element of this entry   apart from gemser s penchant to disrobe completely every time she enters a house  even in front of perfect strangers    is her excursion to india to interview a charlatan guru  george eastman made up to look considerably christ like   who has found a way to prolong coitus indefinitely  of course  when emanuelle calls him up on it  he ends up having premature ejaculation,0,1,0.5194358540604733
i m a jean harlow fan  because she had star quality  i don t think her movies are good and i don t even think that she was a good actress  but she certainly was great in comedies  every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good  but this movie is perhaps more like a love story  jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast   their performances bring nothing new  it always impresses me much to think that harlow s beautiful body was that of an ill woman  well  in this movie she does look beautiful,0,1,0.8900744750935994

i had read a few positive reviews of this film  and was truly surprised at how dreadful the whole thing was  positioned as some cross between an aids related story and some kind of  ghost   blithe spirit  tale  this film can t always make it s mind up what it wants to be  simon and mark are a gay couple who have an  open  relationship   simon is able to have anonymous  though safe  sex on the side when he wants  mark is hiv  and he and simon don t seem to have a sex life anymore  when mark dies  simon   who has made a habit of shutting off his emotions after being rejected years ago by his father   tries to erase his memory and just get on with being a bachelor  not_that his behavior before mark s death was much different  but mark returns in ghostly form and foils his various trysts  while getting simon to open up and admit his true feelings unfortunately  simon is such a selfish sob  it s impossible to feel any empathy toward him for most of the film  by the time he is supposed to be more sympathetic  it s too late to care  mark  on the other hand  follows in demi moore s footsteps from  ghost   by crying profusely throughout the movie  there is a bizarre switch in tone after mark returns  suddenly we get some lame attempts at humor  a la the tv show  bewitched   but that doesn t last long  once simon s emotional health is at stake  the whole thing becomes increasingly mawkish  with amateurish attempts to jerk at your heartstrings  the finale  with a gold plated muscle boy angel guiding a tearful mark to heaven while a chastened  grief stricken simon waves goodbye is just stupefying  chiefly because it isn t intentionally funny,0,1,0.46766228519793895
in its depiction of a miserable milanese underclass  this film was probably quite revealing in its day  however  i get the feeling that neorealism was not_director de sica s bag  since here he decided to try and create some sort of modern fable centring around a boy that had been found in a cabbage patch by an old dear in the country  after spending most of his childhood in an orphanage  toto ends up living in a shantytown in milan  he organises the inhabitants into community action  and keeps their spirits up by swanning around with an annoyingly constant smile on his face and testing them on their times tables  that nobody tells him where to stick his times tables is beyond me  as these people have far more important things to think about  like where the next pot noodle is going to come from  anyway  de sica then uses a sublimely subtle dramatic device in order to highlight exactly why these poor sods are where they are  it s all down to capitalism of course  and in order to illustrate this  he has the miserables discover a fountain of oil on their land  brilliant  to his credit  though  by this time he has given up on making a serious film  and the capitalists appear as severe caricatures  all fur coats and cigars  they want that land  but our mathematical hero will not_support such nonsense  by a bizarre stroke of luck  his old  deceased guardian from the cabbage patch days appears in the sky and gives him a magic dove  he uses it to shower gifts on his mates  who prove just as greedy as the cigar men  i reckon this film was a missed opportunity  to address the theme of poverty   as not_many film makers had done until then  and then get caught up in a fairy tale  to me seems a bit daft  how come  great  directors get away with child like plot turns like the ones we see here  hans christian anderson would probably have balked at the idea of having the poor folk flying off over the milan duomo and on to a higher place on broomsticks  de sica  however  is proclaimed as a genius for this  surely the fact that these people are so poor  that their faith is unswerving  and that miracles not_happen to them  is enough for any story teller to work on,0,1,0.6195105988841857

insignificant and low brained  haha   80 s horror like there are thirteen in a dozen  yet it can be considered amusing if you watch it in the right state of mind  the special effects are tacky  the acting atrocious and the screenplay seems to miss a couple of essential paragraphs   the brain  takes place in a typical quiet american town setting  where every adolescent works in the same diner and where the cool kid in high school flushes cherry bombs down the toilet  it is here that a tv guru named dr  blake and his adorable pet brain begin their quest for nation wide mind controlling  under the label of  independent thinkers   a giant cheesy brain sends out waves through television sets and forces innocent viewers to kill  how cool is that  now  it s up to the meadowvale teen rebel to save the world  the funniest thing about the plot is that it not_explains where dr  blake and his monstrous brain actually come from  there are obvious references towards extraterrestrial life but that s about it  meh  who needs a background in a movie like this  really  there s not_that much bloodshed unfortunately and the  evil  brain looks like an over sized sock puppet  the only more or less interesting element for horror buffs is taking a look at the cast and crew who made this movie  director ed hunt and writer barry pearson are the same men who made  bloody birthday   guilty pleasure of mine  and  plague   both those are much better movies and they wisely decided to resign the film industry  the most familiar face in the cast unquestionably is the great david gale  whom horror fans will worship forever for his role in re animator  a girl named christine kossak provides the nudity factor and she s obviously a great talent she has exactly 3 movies on her repertoire of which this is her  masterpiece   in her debut  she was credited as  runaway model  and in  3 men and a baby   her character is referred to as  one of jack s girls   i really wonder how she feels about her career as an actress,0,1,0.531301080467585

what s to like about this movie   it is in colour  it has some impressive underwater photography  it has a rhythmic musical score in the background that works well at times  so 3 out of 10  sometimes the music is speeded up  especially when the shark or the baddies are about to move in  sometimes it is slowed  as if to convey to the audience it s about to be time for sympathy  as another one bites the dust  as if in a  spagetti western  this has much similarity to  it s not_that the italians can t produce quality productions  there was a series of tv movies with a heading like  octopus  numbered about 1 to 7  screened on sbs tv in australia in the 1990s about mafia type conflicts  and they were excellent  but alas  you won t find it here   i assumed it was made about 1960s  sadly it was 20 years out of date  as evidenced by a funeral scene near the end  then there was the razor sharp bite of the speedy shark that makes for a red dust repeatedly emerging in the bluish waters  amidst it all  either in bar room brawl or in observing the latest sea side bloody demolition by the relentlessly hungry shark  the mate of the hero looks on through his glasses of little concern  as if he too was bored in his relentless role amidst a lack of much evidence of plot or anyone s character development  at least the hero indicates a fleeting concern belatedly  for his ex wife  but of course  even if the music fails to awaken our realisation  we have the sinister sound in the baddies  voices  as if to nudge us that another dark deed is about to emerge  and near the end  someone thought of a twist  just when we thought it was all totally predictable  but stay tuned  folks  for you may find another twist  if you are watching closely  to  more or less  warm your heart  follow the advice of the hero  and have a few beers along the way  it ll make your viewing of  night of the sharks  more enjoyable  then you ll be ready for something like a  007  movie to ease your way back into reality when this is over,0,1,0.599494096346611

i have always said that some plays by their very nature just can t be translated to film  and this one is a prime example as a play  this is a very funny farcical satire of the catholic church  with a razor wit and a central character who is so shockingly unreal we have to root for her even when she starts murdering her parishioners  one of whom made the fatal mistake of admitting he had not_sinned since his last confession  so she feels she is sending him straight to heaven  that s just one example of how far outside of reality the play goes  and in the make believe world of the theater  it works  however  that kind of heightened reality rarely works on film  and it certainly doesn t here director marshall brickman has assembled a fine cast who do great work  but by presenting all this absurdity in a realistic fashion the comedy becomes tragedy and you are left with an empty feeling in the pit of your stomach seek out a production of the stage play instead  you won t be disappointed,0,1,0.43599636821889093
whoa boy ever wanted to watch a documentary about a megalomaniacal jerk ruining his own life and alienating everyone around him  well they exist  in many forms  but have you ever wanted to watch said documentary about one who didn t ultimately succeed in doing anything despite everyone s praises about how much of an artistic  genius  he is  well you could probably just grab a camera and find someone like that in any local scene  i know they re everywhere and i don t even follow the local scene   or you could save yourself the trouble by spending money watching this tripe the premise is good and  honestly  it s not_as if the filmmakers knew precisely where it was going considering that s one of the difficulties of doing a documentary  we are made to follow two bands  the brian jamestown massacre  lead by anton  and the dandy warhols  lead by courtney  i ve heard of the dandy warhols before watching this movie    not_so the brian jamestown massacre  why  well from this documentary s perspective  because the brian jamestown massacre s intergroup dysfunction refused them the ability to really make it in the music industry  however  instead of this becoming an analysis of the two separate bands and how one was able to succeed  the focus becomes much more on anton and his insanity because  see  anton is a  genius   because he plays rock music  he really  understands the evolution of music     because he plays rock music with a lot of different instruments  his music is considered  post modern retro but the future     because it s rock music  he wants to bring out a  revolution     through rock music  okay so let s face it    twenty minutes in and this is one of the stupidest kids i d care to watch a documentary about the documentary itself doesn t really lend itself to showcasing any of anton s talent  because in the nature of editing down 2000 hours of material into a quarter short of two hours we don t really have the time to focus on that  so instead we watch anton   the genius   the socio maniacal loser  be a jerk for the two hours and are just told to understand that he made really great music  whether he did or not_i won t know  because its not_like the documentary had enough time to prove it  what i do know is that then we re left with a story about some self centered obnoxious twerp running around the country calling himself a god of music and doing nothing to back it up  why even bother watching that  people like anton don t deserve the attention they seek  the hope and admiration of all those different people  and especially a post failure paean to lost potential  this movie plays like a two hour rough cut vh1 special for a reason  he goes on and on about the music  but it s all about the image and the attention  look at the guy  look at how he dresses  look at how he acts  look at how he tries to create controversy because he can t afford marketing honestly the only interesting character in this film is joel  and that s because of anyone in this documentary  joel is the only person who seems to have any fun  maybe it s because he s the tambourine man  the rest of them are all  rock stars   they deserve our attention  and admiration  and interest  and engagements  they are out there to  save rock and roll   do you remember when the white stripes were supposed to  save rock and roll   yeah  that was because of anton  and it s  selfish of them not_to mention me  anton  as an inspiration   what a load  people like anton are best left forgotten  this documentary explains why mainstream music is so dull  because music execs have to deal with people like anton for a living and ultimately can only really throw their support behind someone safe and passionless  thanks a lot  anton  your antics ruined music for everyone you touched  whatever the opinion to the contrary is  and if people  in the know  about anton disagree and he really was a genius  it still shows how bad this documentary is that it cuts it down that way   polarisdib,0,1,0.47291850727715645

this tv film tells the story of extrovert frannie suddenly returning to silk hope to visit friends and family  but unaware of her mother s death  her sister runs the family home  but is intending to sell it and move away with her new husband  frannie strongly objects to the idea  and vows to keep the family heirloom as it were  by getting a job and maintaining responsibility in comes handsome ruben and the two soon fall in love  as you do   and it s from this point that i sort of lost interest    there is more to farrah fawcett than just the blonde hair and looks  she can portray a character extremely convincingly when she puts her mind to it   and it is certainly proved here as well as some of her previous efforts like extremities and small sacrificies   a great performance from the legendary charlie s angel silk hope is the type of film that not_shies away from its cheap and cheerful tv image  and you know there was a limit to the budget  but it s not_the worst film ever made  the positive aspects are there  you just have to find them,0,1,0.5059673747535659
although the movie takes place at an  ivy league  college  it was in fact shot entirely in northern arizona  mostly at northern arizona university in flagstaff in the fall of 1976  i was involved in the theater department there  and most of the extras in the film are then members of the theater department  there is an absolutely ludicrous scene in this film  if you know your arizona geography  that shows several cast members riding bikes from the college to a creek  we nau ers know that the campus and said creek  actually oak creek canyon  are about 35 miles apart  and while the trip there is all downhill  it would be literally impossible to ride a bike back up that same road,0,1,0.42511884278111545
i recently bought the dvd  forgetting just how much i hated the movie version of  a chorus line   every change the director attenborough made to the story failed by making the director cassie relationship so prominent  the entire ensemble premise of the musical sails out the window some of the musical numbers are sped up and rushed  the show s hit song gets the entire meaning shattered when it is given to cassie s character the overall staging is very self conscious the only reason i give it a 2  is because a few of the great numbers are still able to be enjoyed despite the film s attempt to squeeze every bit of joy and spontaneity out of it,0,1,0.3902888188888329
to me this just comes off as a soap opera  i guess any depiction of profligate people can be considered  social commentary   but in the final analysis  i simply don t care how you characterize this film  none of the characters are very likable or engaging  i felt not_chemistry between hudson and bacall  if there is a love story here  it is lost in the malaise  and despite the twist ending provided by a complete and immediate  and therefore  incomprehensible  reversal by dorothy maguire on the witness stand  the story is insufficient to hold my interest  not_matter how much freudian symbolism and psychology are throw in  this story is sleazy  melodramatic and trite rock hudson is nobly wooden  this is lauren bacall s least engaging role and one of her poorest performances  dorothy maguire and robert stack deliver more inspired performances  but her character is vile  and his is pathetic  robert keith  as the loving  out of touch father of two miscreant adult children  is the most sympathetic character  most interesting of all  however  is the severe looking robert wilke in a small role as the bar owner  he is best remembered as a nasty henchman in countless westerns  but here he is an honest  likable fellow i take my social commentary with an interesting  engaging story and a few likable characters  thank you,0,1,0.5952615065083676

a damsel in distress  is definitely not_one of fred astaire s better musicals  but even astaire s bad films always had some good moments in  damsel   astaire is jerry halliday  an american musical star who is in london on a personal appearance tour  he meets lady alice marshmorton  19 year old joan fontaine   a beautiful english heiress  who hops into the back of a cab he is taking to escape a mob of admirers jerry believes that alice is being forced into a marriage by her rich aunt  he tries to rescue her from her family s country manor house  but soon discovers that the house staff is laying bets on which suitor lady alice will marry  keggs  reginald gardiner  the conniving butler  and albert  harry watson   the bratty house boy  each take turns alternately helping and sabotaging lady alice s romance with jerry to make sure they win the bet this musical has numerous problems  first  there is the plot  based on a novel by p g  wodehouse  who co wrote the screenplay   the story is slow  painful  and nerve grating  when fred is not_dancing  we have to endure endless annoying scenes of  a  fred romancing joan fontaine or  b  keggs and albert conniving against them and each other the butler and the house boy are especially irritating  they are one dimensional stock villain characters  the kind of guys you just want to punch in the mouth  you wish they would get off the screen and let fred dance astaire suffers in the absence of his usual partner  ginger rogers  joan fontaine is a lackluster leading lady in this film  and is miscast in a musical  she has little going for her  character wise  other than her lovely face and beautiful smile george burns and gracie allen are along for the ride  as jerry s publicist and his ditzy secretary  the duo adds some sorely needed chemistry to the plot  and gracie has some funny lines  but she is also very annoying at times the direction of the movie by george stevens is not_well done  at times  the cinematography is horrible and off focus  there are a number of outdoor scenes set on extremely foggy streets  to try to convince the audience that we are in london  not_wood   they must have used tons of dry ice in this movie   on the plus side  the songs by george and ira gershwin are terrific  and have become classic song standards  and of course  the dancing in the movie is exceptional  thanks to astaire and his choreographer  hermes pan but the musical and dance numbers are ill used and ill staged  at times  the cast seems to start singing and dancing because  well  it s time for them to start singing and dancing  the musical numbers seem randomly inserted into the meandering plot   at one point  the butler steps outside the manor house and breaks into an operetta solo for not_clear reason   the numbers include     i m dancing and i can t be bothered now     fred dances well on a foggy traffic filled london street  he does some great  cane twirling  with a rolled umbrella    but the number ends too soon when fred jumps on a passing double decker bus   in the broadway musical   crazy for you   harry groener did a much better version of this number with a group of chorus girls     put me to the test     fred  george  and gracie do a trio tap dance in an english cottage  george and gracie match fred step for step  but the number ends poorly with everyone kicking each other for not_reason    stiff upper lip   the fun house number     at an amusement park fun house  fred  george  and gracie have fun dancing on the revolving floor  rotating barrel  and with the fun house mirrors  it s the best number of the movie  but it gets a little repetitious at times    things are looking up     fred and joan fontaine do their one dance number together in the film  prancing around the back woods of the country manor estate  fortunately  it s a very simple dance number because joan is not_a great dancer    a foggy day in london town     fred wanders around the foggy manor estate at night  crooning about the foggy day when he first met joan in london  at times  he looks as if he s not_sure which way he s going in the fog    much like the musical number itself    nice work if you can get it     a great song that is misused in the movie  during a social event at the manor house  fred gets drawn into a chorus of dour faced singers who are haphazardly singing this song  each time fred joins in  the other singers look at him as if they wish he would leave   again  harry groener did a better dance number with this song in  crazy for you       drum dance number     as fred and joan are eloping  fred has to stop and do one final tap dance number while banging a group of drums  as usual  it s a great dance number  but there s absolutely not_need for it  except to prolong the movie the most contrived moment in the film comes when fred decides to leap off a high stone balcony at the country estate in order to prove his love for joan fontaine  as he leaps from the balcony  he finds a conveniently placed trapeze    that s right  a  trapeze     hanging from a nearby tree  fred  or rather  a stuntman in fred s clothes  grabs the trapeze and swings to the ground from it the movie is worth owning on dvd for the dance numbers alone  but you feel indebted to the guy who invented the fast forward button on your remote  the   ff button allows you to skip through the other  boring scenes in the film to get to the dance numbers,0,1,0.675113708427587

2 stars for kay francis    she s wonderful  and she didn t deserve this horrible tripe that warner bros  threw her way  the two pronged premise that this movie is based on is ridiculous and unbelievable in the extreme  kay is a small town wife and mother who yearns for something bigger  she wants to be an actress  when a big shot actor comes to town and invites kay to his hotel to talk about possibilities  kay tells her husband she s going to the movies  the hubby s biddy of a mother puts a bug in hubby s ear that kay s not_being truthful  and he sets out looking for her  he finds her w  the actor in the hotel  they are only talking   and he slugs the guy  who falls over a railing  lands face first in a pond  lake    and dies  now here s the two unbelievable premises upon which the rest of the movie is based  1  the judge tells the jury that if it s determined that the man died  before  his head went into the water  that they must find the hubby guilty of first degree murder   whaaaaa       i think slugging a guy in a fit of rage would count for manslaughter or murder 2 at the most  not_first degree murder  give me a break  but the plot required him being found guilty of murder 1 so that he could be sent to prison for life  whatever   2  the hubby s lawyer  after the conviction and sentencing  tells kay that it s all her fault  his reasoning is that if she hadn t gone over to the actor s room  then her husband wouldn t have had to go after her and slug the guy and kill him  he tells her that she s the guilty one  not_her husband  and she nods and agrees  what  the  hell       the rest of the movie is all about kay trying to achieve fame and money in order to get her husband released from prison and right the wrong she committed by causing him to kill the actor dude in the first place i can t even go on with this review  the movie was just all too painful  four years earlier  in the pre code days  you d not_have caught kay playing such a wimp  in true kay francis fashion  though  she did do her best to make us believe that this woman was a believable character  i give her much credit for trying to breathe some life and credibility to this thankless role  this character was a far cry from pre code kay roles and real life spitfire kay francis steer way clear of this one  there are much better kay francis vehicles out there   from personal experience  i can highly recommend mary stevens  md and jewel robbery  also good are dr  monica and one way passage  i m sure there s other great kay flicks as well  but i m only mentioning the ones i ve seen and can recommend,0,1,0.42379615303091167

if this movie was about a fictional character  the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively  unfortunately for the viewer  the movie is based on  facts  that are shaded very unfairly toward ruben carter  many of the smaller facts were disregarded  carter was not_number one contender at the time of the murders  there is not_proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth   but some of the larger facts  like apparently being robbed of a decision to joey giardello because of  racist  judges  is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape  and completely disrespectful to giardello  why hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who  at best  was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be  was arrested multiple times for beating women  is strange to me  ruben carter was not_by viewing his actions in the 60 s and even now  when he refuses to speak to his son  a person that people can look up to  everyone knows that jewison can direct  and washington can act  but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me  is hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable   heres a suggestion how about denzel playing a movie about himself  now thats inspirational  based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie  i would suggest passing on this one,0,1,0.44577472569175747
this movie does not_rock  as others have said  i found it really boring and silly  the story is about this metal high school kid who idolizes this really bad heavy metal singer  the singer dies  but not_before making one last album that is to be played over the radio at  of course  midnight on halloween  which would actually make it november 1st  a much less potent date to be sure   the kid gets a copy of the record and it contains secret hidden back play messages  it also is the key that opens the door so that the really bad metal singer can return to bring havoc and death to the world  the first part of this film is not_a horror film at all  but rather an after school special  we see the metal kid  the outsider  tormented over and over by the popular kids  and he fails to learn the most important lesson in high school movies  when the cool kids who bully you suddenly invite you to a party  don t go  it is a trap  especially if it is a pool party  anybody surprised when he ends up in the water   it was such an after school special that i kept waiting for melissa sue anderson to show up and teach jody foster a lesson so back to the horror part of the film  so this metal kid gets some powers and instead of using them to kill the bully boys  which would have made much more sense   he freaks out and tries to protect all of the bully boys and girls from harm  what  a sensitive hero  what fun is that in a horror movie  thank goodness carrie white did not_follow this lesson  he actually tries to prevent having the music played at the halloween dance  the very music that could unleash a power to kill all the kids who had been mean to him  if it were me  i would have put that music on  and pronto  the rest of the movie is about this metal kid going around town trying to kill the horrible metal star he idolized  why not_partner with him and really do some damage  why you ask  it seems he is in love with one of the popular girls and does not_want her hurt  more appropriate for a molly ringwald film  is this a horror film or an episode of beauty and the beast  the movie just goes on and on at this point  with not_scares  horror  or anything worth watching  if you went to high school in the late 80s like i did  this movie is fun to have a little flashback to fashions and big hair  but that is it for this film  skip it and stay home and just listen to some kiss,0,1,0.3982941687646105

what ever happened to one of the most innovative and brilliant storytellers of our time  well  he made the kind of typical summer action fodder that could ve been directed by anybody available out of film school   and in fact  they probably would ve done a better job  they would ve at least have put half of a thought into the dreadful script mark wahlberg plays an astronaut who traveled through some sort of wormhole and landed in a planet ruled by apes   gasp   except this time around  the apes squirm through groan worthy dialogue  nonsensical plotting  and showy special effects that constantly reinforce in my mind that this money could ve been put to about 10 independent films that would have been considered  masterpiece  next to this tripe as much as i enjoy the superb acting talent that is tim roth  his performance as evil ape leader thade is nothing more than an intense composition of slouching and heavy breathing  luckily for him  the makeup allows he as an actor to maintain some dignity and most of the crap dialogue is hidden behind his groans and sniffles and alas  the always dependable hollywood tradition of taking the male and female leads and hooking them up at the end without any relationship development or cause  and the  haha  we re so clever  aren t we   way that hollywood intermingles references from the original pota into this one  sigh   instead of seeing this  spend the night in and call up some friends and rent  ed wood    edward scissorhands    batman   or even to a lesser extent  sleepy hollow   and reminisce about the days when tim burton was a man of vision and originality   not_shame and ridicule,0,1,0.3695660660930449
if the term itself were not_and semantically meaningless  one might well refer to  ned kelly  as an  australian western   for the people down under  ned kelly was  apparently  a folk hero bandit akin to robin hood  jesse james  bonnie and clyde  and butch cassidy and the sundance kid  the descendant of irish immigrants  kelly became a fugitive and an outlaw after he was falsely accused of shooting an australian law officer  a crime for which his equally innocent mother was put into prison  to get back at the government for this mistreatment  kelly  his brother dan  and two other companions  became notorious bank robbers  winning over the hearts of many people in the countryside while striking a blow for justice in a land where irish immigrants were often treated with disrespect and disdain by those who ran the country perhaps because we ve encountered this  gentleman bandit  scenario so many times in the past   ned kelly  feels awfully familiar and unoriginal as it pays homage to any number of the genre s stereotypes and clichés on its way to the inevitable showdown  ned is the typical heart of gold lawbreaker who kills only when he is forced to and  even then  only with the deepest regret  he also has the pulse of the common folk  as when  in the middle of a bank robbery  he returns a valuable watch to one of the customers  after one of his gang has so inconsiderately pilfered it  what movie on this particular subject hasn t featured a scene like that  it s acts of selective generosity like this  of course  that earn him the love and respect of all the little people who come to secretly admire anyone who can get away with sticking it to the powers that be and the status quo  geoffrey rush plays the typical bedeviled law enforcer who feels a personal stake in bringing down this upstart troublemaker who keeps getting away with tweaking the establishment  there s even the inevitable episode in which one of the ladies being held up goes into the next room and has sex with one of the robbers  so turned on is she by the romantic derring do of the criminal lifestyle  and the film is riddled with one hackneyed scene like this after another heath ledger fails to distinguish himself in the title role  providing little in the way of substance to make his character either interesting or engaging  it doesn t help that he has been forced to provide a droning voice over narration that underlines the sanctimoniousness and pretentiousness of both the character and the film  ned kelly  might serve a function of sorts as a lesson in australian history  but as an entertainment  it s just the same old story told with different accents,0,1,0.6973917671063704
a great opportunity for and indy director to make an interesting film about a rock musician on the brink of stardom  it could have been a decent film if it would have dealt with john livien s traumatic past and how it is torturing his psyche  instead  it is a ridiculous attempt to identify john livien s life with john lennon s  john livien s suicida mother s hero was john lennon and she wished for him to become as powerful and prolific as lennon himself  instead of focusing on john lennon s musical brilliance  and his wonderful ability to bare himself for others to learn something about their own life  it showed lennon s legacy to be that of a confused  drug addicted soul  who should looked upon as a god instead a man  i am a huge john lennon fan and this movie reminded me of another  crazy  person obsessed with lennon  lennon s killer   mark david chapman  lennon was a man who was brutally murdered by someone else who had an identity crisis with lennon  do we need to be reminded of that  john lennon gave so much to the world with his music and honesty and i was repulsed to see another disturbed person  as the main character in this movie obsessed by lennon  and not_show his beautiful contributions to the world  yoko ono graciously honored john lennon s memory by making the memorial in central park to give his fans a chance to pay their respects  and remember john  instead the director of this movie chose to use that site to have the killer attempt to commit suicide  i found this so disturbing and disrespectful to lennon s memory  he was a man of peace who died a brutal senseless death  and to see such violence near this site felt like a revisiting a terrible wound for any lennon fan  it ruined the movie completely for me   it could have been a decent movie  but it left me with a bitter taste in my mouth  let john lennon  and his family rest in peace and not_be reminded of his vicious murder by this irresponsible movie,0,1,0.47510771916693534
spielberg loves the smell of sentiment in the morning  but sentiment at the expense of narrative honesty  nobody should love that     lucius shepard the color purple  takes place in the deep south during the early 1900s  and tells the story of celie and nettie  two african american sisters  the film opens with the girls playing in a field of purple flowers  an idyllic haven which is promptly shattered by the appearance of their stepfather  this motif   innocence interrupted by men   permeates the entire film the film then launches into a series of short sequences  celie is revealed to have been twice impregnated by her stepfather  gives birth in a dirty barn  has her newborn child taken away and is forced to marry a local widow named albert johnson  a violent oaf who rapes her repeatedly  forcing her to cook  clean and look after his children all these horrific scenes are given little screen time  and are instead surrounded by moments of pixie dust cinematography  a meddlesome symphonic score  incongruous comedy and overly exuberant camera work  the cumulative effect is like the merging of a disney cartoon and a rape movie  a jarring aesthetic which caused stanley kubrick to remark that  the color purple  made him so nauseated that he had to turn it off after ten minutes  ten minutes  he lasted a long time the film is often said to deal which  racism    sexism  and  black culture   but this is not_true  alice walker  the author of the novel upon which the film is based  claims to be a bisexual but is actually a closet lesbian  her book is a lesbian fantasy  a story of female liberation and self discovery  which paints men as violent brutes who stymie women  for walker  the only way out of this maze is for women to bond together in a kind of lesbian utopia  black sisterhood and female independence celebrated spielberg s film  however  re frames walker s story through the lens of comforting american mythologies  this is a film in which the salvific power of christianity overcomes the natural cruelty of men  a film in which albert finds himself in various ridiculous situations  moments of misplaced comedy inserted to make him look like a bumbling fool  a film in which all the characters are derived from racist minstrel shows  the cast comprised of lecherous men  always beaming with devilish smiles and toothy grins   stereotypical fat mammies  jazz bands and gospel choirs  this is a film in which black people are naturally childlike  readily and happily accepting their social conditions  a film in which black people are over sexed  carnal sensualists dominated by violent passions  a film in which poverty and class issues are entirely invisible  albert lives in a huge house  and black men are completely inept  this is not_the old south  this is the old south as derived from  gone with the wind   mgm muscals   song of the south   warner cartoons   halleluha   and banned disney movies  in other words  it s the south as seen by a child raised on 50s tv  it s all so cartoonish  so racist in the way it reduces these human beings to one dimensional ethnic stereotypes  that black novelist ishmael reed famously likened it to a nazi conspiracy of course  in typical spielberg fashion the film ends with family bonds being healed  this reconciliation was in walker s novel  but spielberg goes further by having every character in the story reconcile with their kin beyond walker s hate letter to black men and spielberg s bizarre caricaturing of black life  we are shown nothing of the black community  we have only the vaguest ideas as to how any of these characters make a living and not_insight into how they interact with others in their community  instead  spielberg s camera jumps about  desperately fighting for our attention  one of celie s kitchen contraptions seems like it belongs in a  home alone  movie   every emotion over played  the director not_stopping to just observe something or to allow a little bit of life to simply pass by  couple this with quincy jones  ridiculously  white  music  and you have one of the strangest films in cinema history  an angry feminist tract filmed by a white jew in the style of disney and griffith  scored by a black man trying to emulate john williams problematic too is the lack of white characters  consider this  the men in this film aren t portrayed as being rough to each other  nor do they dominate women because they are brutalised by a racist society which reduces their manhood  not_they are cruel by nature  and the women  whether quietly suffering like celie or rebellious and tough like her sister  persevere and survive only because the men are too stupid to destroy them  a better film would not_have focused solely on the oppression of women as it occurs among the oppressed  rather  it would have shown that it is societal abuse which has led to spousal abuse  that enslaved black women are forced to perform the very same tasks as their male counterparts  whilst still fulfilling traditional female roles  and that african american domestic violence occurs largely because of economic factors  women unable to support themselves and their children alone and so there s a hidden ideology at work here  late in the film one character tells another that since he didn t respect his wife  she wound up getting severely beaten and imprisoned by whites  the implication is that blacks need to return to their african roots to restore their own dignity and that it is their fault that whites unjustly crush them  ie  respect one another in your poor minority community and you won t run afoul of the dominant white culture  3 10   a failure to confront sex and lesbianism  inappropriate musical numbers  countless sequence loaded with extraneous visual pizazz  incongruous comic business  emphatic music cues  and wildly hyped emotionality  all contribute to rendering  the color purple  worthless,0,1,0.41403717962917813
star rating        the works      just misses the mark     that little bit in between    lagging behind   the pits in this debut effort for nick park s beloved man and dog  they are forced to fly to the moon when good old wallace runs out of cheese as well as being the shortest feature at just 22 minutes  this w g adventure is also the earliest and it kinda shows  the plasticine animation is a little creaky and funny here  sort of reminiscent of the mork animation about the little man in the box admirable though the craftsmanship behind it is  i ve not_been hugely into wallace   gromit  maybe a bit too clean and traditional for someone of my generation   the only one i ve really enjoyed is the wrong trousers  and that was more from when i was younger and less aware of  shall we say  the seedier pleasures of life   i was driven to actively seek out this early effort due to the resurgence in popularity as a result of the hugely successful recent film adaptation as technically impressive as the first two  all things considered   this one lacks the emotional angle it s successors were to possess  that being said  it s fairly good fun as a first try and certainly set the standard for greater things to come  two stars  but a good two stars,0,1,0.6788459498159481
this is one of the worst b slashers i ve ever seen in my life  the ending is something you have to see to believe the movie starts with harry standing and phillip standing sitting on the stairs with their mother watching their father come down the chimney while dressed in a santa suit  he puts the presents under the tree  eats the cookies and milk and then goes back up the chimney  phillip goes to bed but harry comes down only to find his father dressed in a santa suit sexually pleasuring his mother  then  harry goes up stairs  smashes a snow globe  grabs a shard of glass  and cuts himself then you move on to the present  you see harry  he is a lonely man who sleeps in a santa suit and watches little kids through a pair of binoculars  he has two books  one book for good kids and the other for bad kids  he writes down everything they do in these books  the guy is a creep  he also works at the jolly dream toy factory  his brother phillip has a family and two kids and lives in a nice house when harry finds out that his boss only cares about profits  he goes and collects all the toys and delivers them to a few kids  then  he travels to a church and kills 4 people  then he goes to another house and puts presents under the tree  the kids catch him but they go back to bed  so  harry goes to the bedroom and kills the father and leaves as he is walking towards a house  a bunch of kids spot him and run up to him  the parent s are nervous and try to get their kids to come back to them so they don t get hurt  how do they know that harry is the killer  sure  you have to be suspicious because you not_know who it could be  harry gives the kids presents and the father pulls out a switch blade in an attempt to stab him in front of the kids when harry runs off  the townsfolk light torches and follow him to kill him  they don t even know that he is the killer  when harry reaches his brother s house  his his brother and him have a little talk and phillip strangles him  he only loses consciousness  phillip loads harry back into his van  when harry wakes up  he takes off the ending is something i could not_believe  once again  you ll have to see it to believe it one thing that bugged me was the black santa  that s right  the man in the santa suit they saw was a white man  so why did they bring in a black man skip this and see silent night deadly night and santa s slay  you ll get your money s worth seeing those two films  they are better than this pile of garbage  i give this movie 1 star out of 10  wish i could give it 0 stars cause that is what this movie deserves,0,1,0.5418649037435199

after reading some very good reviews about this film i thought i would give it a watch and after being very disappointed with the film i thought i would give it my own review  this is my first ever so bare with me first of all i would scratch horror from the genre as in not_way is it horrific or scary in the slightest  with the exception of a few feeble attempts to make you jump unfortunately one of which worked on me   i would say that calling this film a thriller is pushing it as i wasn t particularly thrilled either  the film is about a spoiled mischievous girl who faints a few times  during these times she visits a house which she has been drawing  after each visit she decides to add something else to the house to make it a bit more lively one of the features being a sad little boy who is also ill in reality  as she befriends the boy she realises that her imaginary world that she created is actually better than the real world that she is in  until she adds her constantly away father to the house  due to a misdrawing her dad turns out to be evil and her and the boy must escape from his clutches think its an attempt to be a slightly more mellow version of a nightmare on elm street but is more like a trip to the beach in conclusion my generous 3 10 will hopefully stop at least one of you from watching this drab,0,1,0.5237636464010694

on the face of it  ruiz has set out to make a psychological thriller  although it s not_as satisfying as a classic piece in that genre  there are compensations  the tensions generated between huppert and balibar as women calmly but calculatingly at war over a boy they both claim are compelling  however  in a true european art house style  ruiz doesn t give us release of this tension as the women alternately also try to behave compassionately towards each other  the only raised voice is that of huppert s waking from a nightmare  an uncontested irrational event in the film  in fact  if we follow the title  the film is as little about its thriller skeleton as jane campion s in the cut  instead it is an intergender psychological study focusing on men  the boy  camille  nils hugon   decides on a practical joke  playing his mother off against an emotionally vulnerable other woman  both women seem to pander to him rather than scold and this compounds the problem  in the background is an intemperate psychologist  charles berling   swift to confront the women in his life   his sister huppert  the nanny or his pa   and so acting as a symbolic adult counterbalance to the  calm and  we learn  manipulative camille  it is particularly interesting that  like the father in henry james  the turn of the screw  denis podalydes  law enforcer father is absent for the duration of the film  ruiz fashions an oedipal moment out of huppert s reaction to his return at the film s close read either as a thriller or as a psychiatric essay  this film is ultimately rather disappointing  i m officially rather fed up with mme huppert s screen method  which is too buried and so i ll be looking to see her on stage before i come back to her  european   enjoyed heaven s gate  films again  the support is good  ruiz does the cast not_favours though  quite apart from some poor lighting and some wilfully odd shots  its as if his direction has left characterisation quite out of reach   i m thinking particularly of edith scob s shamanic neighbour to isabelle  who acts knowing but communicates bafflement  the set pieces do not_link up to a forward driving plot   the tension i have already referred to is not_weakly dissipated but wasted in its directional potential want to see a good contemporary french thriller  go and see l appartement instead  4 10,0,1,0.3626728293015548

the idea of making a miniseries about the berlin airlift seemed to me as one of the more interesting german  post war movies  it is a theme that has not_been explored much as yet  however  the makers of this series stuffed it with clichés  it starts already with the dvd cover of the movie  which is a direct copy of the cover of  pearl harbor  luise kielberg  bettina zimmermann  gets to hear that her husband  who is a doctor   ulrich noethen  has died in russia and after the war she s struggling to survive  she finds a job at the american base  gets to work for the coolest and highest ranking officer  heino ferch  in town  falls in love with  m  gets pregnant  and all of a sudden her husband turns up again  come on    we ve seen this once too often  heino ferch and ulrich noethen play their role quite well  bettina zimmermann however not_seems to convince  for some reason it always seems she s somewhat too late in giving the right emotional reaction to the scenes  it just didn t work for me the action scenes with the planes and the air lift  we re sometimes exciting  more often not_nasty things always seemed to happen to the same pilot unless you re a big fan of wwii movies  i suggest you spend your money on something else  chocolate ice cream brings a lot more satisfaction 4 out 10,0,1,0.538418074000351

don t you just hate it when you order steak but the restaurant gives you chicken such is how i felt watching this so called  battlestar galactica   arguments can be made over its quality but the fact remains  it s not_what the fans ordered imagine if you were sitting down at that proverbial restaurant i mentioned  you have waited years for them to bring back their famous new york strip steak which you loved  when your meal arrives  you find they ve applied the name  new york strip  to a chicken dish  you complain but the waiter merely states  but ze cheeken  ees really good zir   do you really care if the chicken is good  you wanted new york strip   a steak  the waiter then explains   you zee zir  ze chef wanted to to do  as you zay  zomezing new  we felt ze cheeken would be more popular zo we gave it the name of our previous delicious deesh   you ask if you will ever find the original new york strip on the menu in the future but are informed that because the restaurant has a dish called  new york strip  now on the menu  you ll not_see the original new york strip   ever again such is the case with creating something new and slapping the  battlestar galactica  namesake on it   this mini series is an affront to all fans of the original show   it s a shame the production team put in charge of this new version obviously held contempt for the original  the team put in charge of resurrecting bg should have loved the original series   seeking to improve what the fans loved  not_try to shamelessly sell this new series by exploiting the battlestar galactica name if scifi channel wanted to give us a new show  then do so  give it a new name  don t use the name we fondly remember in an attempt to lure in viewers  that effectively robs us of the chance to see any semblance of the original in the future we have been waiting for 25 years to see what we knew as bg because we liked something about the original  we didn t simply want the name and remnants of the basic concept  there are things we loved about the original series sadly  probably the best elements of the original were those which were omitted  sure  the original bg was imperfect and could have used some updating  this mini series  however  was not_an improvement in any regards but the special effects  which were good but not_anything unusual by today s standards  many viewers will debate back and forth about the quality of this new show but we will not_forgive scifi and ron moore for destroying our dream that being said    i shall offer some comments about the merits of this new mini by itself  not_in comparison to the original  the battle sequences were the best part  effort was obviously put into making the effects more  real  in appearance and less  wow   look at that effect   i would not_say these sequences were exceptional by today s standards yet they were in keeping with made for cable original movies  what was the deal with this  pseudo live cam   some views tried to fake the effect of a  real  camera with lagging tracking and jerky zooms  however  it was over used considering there was not_apparent source of these cameras  the infinitely more intelligent series  babylon 5  is the only instance i ve seen such  live cams  used effectively  when we were supposedly witnessing action from security cams the script  you ask  the script felt like it was written by a teenager  for other teenagers  the characters felt cardboard and stereotypical  indeed  the whole story felt pieced together from other well known stereotypes  the only good features of the entire story were those few elements which were preserved from the original series  it was obviously  dumbed down  for digestion of your average tv audience the human interaction was pitiful  rather than drama based on subtle looks  expressions and fine timing  every moment of human tension was exaggerated to the point of being so obvious they lost all ability to move any refined viewer  such was obvious in any interaction between adama and son  the director must have been trying to make sure the most dense and unfeeling viewer wouldn t miss it even if not_paying attention  sorry  but real humans don t behave like the continually i wouldn t have considered this a bad show had it stood on its own  nothing great  it will not_be revered by true scifi fans or artisans  but it would be watchable by the masses  i personally could have lived without it  though  i only watched it to see how it really did capture the spirit of the original  how this mini series will always be remembered is as a symbol of how quality in storytelling has been cast aside to appeal to greater numbers  how even scifi channel has  dumbed down  its productions to cater to the masses as opposed to its true niche market  the science fiction fans  it will be the time we asked for steak and they insisted on giving us chicken  despite our complaints i leave you with only one thought   not_moore,0,1,0.4089445753592212

this is a low budget spoof of the espionage genre  to help frame your expectations  you should know that   1  the acting is wildly heavy handed  the stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement  frequent hand gestures  and off key pacing   2  the script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility  oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely not_relevance to previous plot elements   3  shots are frequently framed in off balance angles  poking fun at genre excesses   4  a pop eyed jeff goldblum delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic manner the film has a guiding intelligence  deliberately starting with a plot element stolen from the b films of the 1930 s  a secret code with a structure that would defy explanation by carl sagan  the film s over the top acting is used mostly for comic effect during the first 90 minutes  in an early running gag  fay grim s son ned is so frequently told to leave that you can t help chuckling while feeling sorry for the lad  parker posey s nicely choreographed fall from bed also helps set a humorous tone early in the film the film s slow pacing does not_enhance the comedy elements or the drama elements that later emerge  the film s impact as drama is significantly lessened by the early comedy  moreover  it is hard to be overly involved with the characters and their fates when the early portions of the film are so sarcastic  the musical score is intentionally heavy handed  and i found this  and the off kilter camera angles  more irritating than humorous the over the top acting  the implausible and nearly incomprehensible plot of conspiracies counter conspiracies  and the slow pacing will grind on many viewers  the movie is much too long at 158 minutes that said  fans who are receptive to the film s sarcasm might want to watch again     using closed captioning to best catch the intelligent ridiculousness of the dialog  the film was too slow for me and the sarcasm felt more heavy handed than light hearted  but  the comedy may well appeal to your tastes  the film is worth a view for those who enjoy independent films  fans of director hal harley  or devotees of parker posey  who has the most camera time,0,1,0.5057864377756824

jack london s life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him  sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character jack london who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around  he wrote on what he knew  but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him  some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism  but this was world war ii and london was a big believer in the  yellow peril  as it was called back in the day two thirds of the film covers his life as author  we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for the sea wolf  we see him up in the yukon in a miner s cabin with a dog that was not_doubt his inspiration for the call of the wild  london was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since the final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the russo japanese war  london was a socialist  but his socialism did not_encompass folks who were oriental  like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the chinese and japanese to our pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people  he advocated strict immigration policies for orientals the film puts the cart before the horse  london is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the russo japanese war what japan s ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was  actually the kind of atrocities present in world war ii were not_existent during the russo japanese conflict  japan had her imperial ambitions  but so did everyone else including the usa at that time  but our immigration policies caused by pressure from our west coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with japan over a couple of generations  london was part of the cause not_a prophet crying in the wilderness this film was the first independent production of samuel bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than jack london  had he a bit more money bronston might have gotten james cagney or spencer tracy  both who would have been right for the role  instead they got michael o shea who was making his second film after lady of burlesque  o shea is fine in the part  but certainly was not_box office as london is covering the war  he meets up with a captain tanaka who is played by leonard strong  an actor who specialized in orientals and played a ton of them in world war ii  from the vantage point in 1905 strong outlines in the best fu manchu tradition japan s imperial aims right up to taking on the usa eventually  must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd  a lot of course is left out of london s life including a first wife  playing the second and only wife in this film is susan hayward who only comes into the movie when it s half over  i wish we d have seen more of her  charmian kittredge london survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955 o shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in jack london  virginia mayo has a small role in jack london and they married for 30 years until o shea died in 1973 maybe one day we ll get a view of jack london that will be a lot better than this one,0,1,0.8585557146486171

seriously the only good thing about this year ceremony were the winners although the ceremony itself was pretty short it still was somewhat boring  i think it s seriously time to look for a new director and producers for the show  who can come up with something really new  it s pretty obvious that they tried to make the show more  hip  and appealing for a younger audience this year by letting beyonce perform and letting p  diddy and prince present a category  also letting chris rock be the presenter was an attempt to re new the ceremony and make it more appealing  none of it really worked out sure  chris rock is a funny guy but he wasn t really a good presenter  i really merely saw him as a guy who just talked every now and then in between of the different categories  his presence wasn t really as  big  as for instance billy crystal s also the handing out of the awards was pretty dumb at times  not_letting everybody come to the stage but also handing out some of the awards in the middle of the theater was plain weird still  i can t remember being any more satisfied with the award winners  none of the movies really swept away the awards as the last couple of years always had been the case  so does that mean it had been a good year for movies with lots of competitive contestants  i don t think so  i think most of the movies will be largely forgotten in 20 years from now  with the exception of  million dollar baby  and  the passion of the christ  maybe  sure i don t agree with every single award that was handed out this year  for instance caleb deschanel should had won for best cinematography  not_that i don t like robert richardson s work  he really did some amazing work for most of oliver stone s work but i really feel that deschanel deserved the award way more  also i would had liked seeing jim miller and paul rubell win for best editing and john debney for best music  but oh well  there is not_way the academy awards can please everybody of course  i understand that  there will always be people complaining about the winners it also was funny to see that most of the award presenters were way more nervous than the nominees and winners  did prince said any of the nominees names right at once  and were is sean penn s sense of humor  al pacino and jeremy  i hope they missed  irons were the best presenters of the night overall a very forgettable show but with nice winners 4 10,0,1,0.555871840007238

within the realm of science fiction  two particular themes consistently elicit interest  were initially explored in the literature of a pre cinematic era  and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike  with varying degrees of success  the first theme  that of time travel  has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film  as well as the written word  most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h g  wells classic   the time machine   the second theme  which also manages to hold audiences in thrall  is that of invisibility  which sparks the imagination with it s seemingly endless and myriad possibilities  and this theme  too  has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h g  wells classic   the invisible man   the realization of which  here  is  hollow man   directed by paul verhoeven  and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue sebastian caine  bacon  and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u s  government  exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility  which they have  at last  achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method  they have  in fact  progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured  their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original  visual  state of being  it s a problem  however  that caine  after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab  has solved   or so he thinks  and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful  he decides to present the results to the board of directors  in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project at the last minute  though  caine demurs  fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level   the testing of a human subject  and he takes it upon himself to become that subject  securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they ve been given approval by the board to do so  but something goes wrong  and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility  and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it s too late  it all begins to take a toll on caine s mind  and suddenly  his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential  as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that  now there s a very real chance that he may lose everything   including himself verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting  even thought provoking film  he establishes a good pace and uses the f x at his disposal to great effect  though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development  anyone familiar with  the invisible man   or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story  will know early on that caine is not_destined for happier times  still  verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience  but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax  and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful  opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood and gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he s worked for earlier in the film  rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine s suffering  and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it s inevitable conclusion  verhoeven takes the low road  and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level  any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind  along with anything that would have made this a memorable film  and it s a shame  because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre  and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable  if only on the surface  which seemingly serves verhoeven s purposes perfectly  there s little depth to bacon s portrayal  but it has more to do with his director s agenda than his own acting abilities  verhoeven simply does not_allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent  the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story  and toward that end  it works  the film would have been better served  however  had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part  something that would have drawn them in a bit  rather than leaving them at the gate  as it were  as mere observers of an f x laden extravaganza elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay  caine s willing accomplice in the ill fated experiment  but it s basically a thankless part that offers little challenge  especially to an actor of shue s caliber  the same can be said of kim dickens  so magnificent in the 2001 film   things behind the sun    her character  sarah kennedy  does little more than support the action and f x  both actors are capable of so much more  and deserve better than what they are given to work with here the supporting cast includes josh brolin  matthew   greg grunberg  carter   joey slotnick  frank   mary randle  janice  and william devane  dr  kramer   entertaining to a point  and even successful on a certain  low  level   hollow man  is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been  like an annual fireworks display  it will give you some momentary thrills  but after awhile it ll begin to blend in with all the others you ve seen  without anything special to set it apart  and it s too bad  because given the talent and abilities of those involved here  it could have been so much more  i rate this one 4

i was in second grade  12 years ago  i remember it clearly  we were learning about space  all little kids want to go to space  right  well  after i saw this  i was so scared to death that i would  accidentally  get flung into space by some psychotic robot with a one track mind  i had not_idea that this was a movie  i thought it was some news program or something  i guess it was my own version of when people were freaked out by the radio program  war of the worlds   so  recently  i get this movie again to watch  realizing my favorite actor  joaquin phoenix was in it  then known as leaf phoenix   i can tell you  i was laughing at the dramatic parts and laughing even harder at the acting  i mean  when andy is in space  she moves in slow motion  did you ever notice that  i don t think being in space makes you talk that slow or think that slow the best part is when andy is knocked unconscious by the oxygen tank  and begins to float backwards as the security doors close  little max is trying to pull her in  suddenly  we get a major close up on max s face as he shouts  in slow motion   whaaaaatttt ssss happpeniiiinngggg       i had not_idea,0,1,0.735258990249884
this film has all the earmarks of too many cooks spoiling the stew  based on shielah graham s autobiography  it seems like the powers that be couldn t leave well enough alone  they couldn t decide if this was to be graham s story or fitzgerald s story  and also how much they should soft pedal whoever s story it turned out to be  so a film that could have been a story about two fascinating  fitzgerald  and notorious  ms  graham personalities becomes a dreary disjointed soap opera about that tells us little about either  added to this there is absolutely not_period feel other than for 1959  clumsy scene follows clumsy scene and we have not_idea where we are in the story or how much time is passing  however   and this saved the film for me   kerr has not_looked lovelier  and peck is as always a very handsome man  they truly make a beautiful  mature couple  and i only wish they had better material to work with  there is one scene that does work   scott goes after shielah while in a drunken state  and to see these two normally refined stars knock each other around is very disturbing and gives some fleeting idea of what goes on in a relationship such as theirs  other than that  the movie is a wasted opportunity and achieves nowhere near the classic stature of other wald produced soaps of the 1950  peyton place  the best of everything,0,1,0.4024169614493442
i rented this dvd for two reasons  a cast of great actors  and the director  even though robert altman can be hit or miss  in this case  it was a big miss  altman s attempt at creating suspense fell on its keester  after seeing kenneth branagh in a good film like  dead again   i didn t think he could possibly contribute to such a turkey  and i hope it didn t ruin his reputation  robert duvall seems to have fallen the way of most one time oscar winners  on a downward spiral that includes acting in eating money films such as this one  duvall was once a great actor in excellent films  even though his best performance was not_tender mercies   but  the great santini   this movie was truly a big waste of time  i give it a 2 out of 10,0,1,0.6388562303770233
although the flock has some pretty good acting by veteran richard gere  and some okay shots that might harken some back to the silence of the lambs days  the movie stretches credibility to the breaking point and destroys itself against a plot that really leads nowhere the film is about erroll babbage  gere  who works for the department of safety and is preparing to retire  his office thrusts upon him his replacement  allison lowry  claire danes  stardust   who quickly discovers that babbage is obsessed with his job  and that job ain t very fun  he monitors hundreds of sexual offenders who are on parole in his jurisdiction  allison goes with erroll on many calls to check up on his  flock  of offenders and learns that he is in desperate need of retirement  but erroll is good at his job even if his methods aren t  he taunts sexual predators and even has physical conflicts with them  erroll justifies his actions by bringing up these deviants  pasts  it is this  good justification  that challenges the audience on some level  letting us see how brutal erroll is and yet how out of touch he s become  by being too close to his job  when a teenage girl goes missing in erroll s  area   he immediate leaps to the conclusion that she was abducted by one of his flock  but how could he know  is erroll that good at his job  allison challenges him and erroll pushes back  their battles become as fierce as erroll s need to find this missing girl although the set up for the story was okay  it didn t have any umpf  i will give credit to richard gere  however  who plays the erroll character very well  battling retirement  worried about everyone who s near his flock  disgusted with those he s responsible for overseeing  disgusted with himself for having to do some of things he does  quite a change in character portrayal for gere  but beyond him there s not_much else  some of the sets are okay  dark and dangerous  but there are so many other problems as to be laughable i ll be the first to admit that suspending disbelief is a requirement whenever watching films  but that suspension has limits  the biggest push against those limits is the destruction of extremely vital crime scenes  someone as meticulous as erroll would know that moving a body would be a huge not_no  or trampling through a crime scene  or moving evidence  it went beyond and hurt the film to not_end the other damaging part of this film is that we not_get into clair danes  character  allison  she s almost dropped by the wayside at the end of the film and we re not_privy to what her intension might be  will she stay or leave  will she end up like erroll if she does stay  this isn t a horrible film as it does touch on some uncomfortable moral ground  but the story as a whole needed to be tightened up,0,1,0.7493378303570594
i ve always liked fred macmurray  and although her career was tragically cut short i think carole lombard is fun to watch  pair these two major and attractive stars together  add top supporting players like jean dixon  anthony quinn  dorothy lamour and charles butterworth  give them a romantic script  team them with noted director mitchell leisen and you geta mediocre movie experience skid johnson  fred  and maggie  carole   meet cute  during her visit to the panama canal  and spend the next few weeks falling in love  skid s a great trumpeter  so he embarks on a musical career  which is predictably meteoric in both its rise and fall  during his climb to musical stardom  he neglects maggie  who later inspires him to start over after he s hit rock bottom  ah  yesit s the true hollywood happy ending  which comes none too soon stars and a director of this caliber should guarantee success  but this movie is so predictable and slow paced that it s difficult to watch at times  the early scenes set in panama are so draggy that they seem to go on forever  and later an alcoholic skid just wanders endlessly in new york  fred and carole try their best  but the tired script and s l o w direction just don t give them a chance  even the final scene  in which maggie encourages skid to rise from the ashes of alcohol and disappointment  just doesn t ring true this movie should be seen once to watch some early performances from stars macmurray and lombard  however  i guarantee that watching it will seem to take about 48 hours,0,1,0.5000913003551403
i am a big fan of arnold vosloo  finally seeing him as the star of a recent movie  not_just a bit part  made me happy unfortunately i took film appreciation in college and the only thing i can say that i didn t like was that the film was made in an abandoned part of town and there was not_background traffic or lookie loos i have to say that the acting leaves something to be desired  but arnold is an excellent actor  i have to chalk it up to lousy direction and the supporting cast leaves something to be desired i love arnold vosloo  and he made the film viewable  otherwise  i would have written it off as another lousy film i found the rape scene brutal and unnecessary  but the actors that got away at the end were pretty good  but the sound effects of the shoot out were pretty bad  there are some glitches in the film  continuity  but they are overlookable considering the low caliber of the film all in all i enjoyed the film  because arnold vosloo was in it jackie,0,1,0.4749914890249123
when i d seen the name of this movie  i d always thought it was a musical  like  the harvey girls   it s not_it s a pudding that overcooked  hit the kitchen ceiling  and was pried off and cobbled together  not_music and not_a period piece but thoroughly improbable it starts with patriarch james woods telling the eldest of his three daughters  a small child who grows to be barbara stanwyck  that she must maintain the family name and home we thus think it is going to be a historical intergenerational tale  and it is  for a brief time  then it turns into the story of cold hearted stanwyck s fight against lawyer george brent  why is she so dead set against him  well  why else  as we learn in a strange flashback sequence narrated by stanwyck  she had once thought she could inherit some money  for her sisters as well as herself  of course  by marrying  she hit on someone she took to be a country bumpkin  who was in fact budding lawyer brent lest anyone think the child they had  a young man of eight or so at the time of the main plot  is    well  you know     they had a hasty marriage and during the very short time they were together  he was conceived one of her sisters is in love with a painter named gig young  who is played by gig young  the other sister tries to take him away  etc   etc it is a shrill  unengaging mess    well enough acted but without a shred of logic or plausibility,0,1,0.7761464400020746
as an avid fan of the flashman books by george mcdonald fraser  i looked forward immensely to seeing flashy on the big screen when this film was first released  sadly it was a huge disappointment then   so i left it alone for 20 years before going back to watch it again  but it was not_better the second time  mr fraser is a tremendously skillful writer  but i am not_a fan of his film screenplay work with richard lester  the penchant for slapstick spoilt  the three musketeers  for me and the same applies here  to me  the whole tone and feel of the film is wrong  the flashman books are uproariously funny in parts  but they are adventure novels  there is much seriousness in the way the adventures that flashman has   after all  he is involved in dangerous situations  this is conveyed in the novels  but not_conveyed at all on film due to the its comedic style  it is a tremendous shame as it could have a great film had it been a more faithful adaptation of the style of the book  when i first read that the book was to be filmed  the article said that the film was to star oliver reed  i rejoiced  as reed to me was the epitome of flashman  how i would have loved to see him in the role  malcolm mcdowell is a good actor  but does not_fit the visual image of flashman created by the books  too scrawny looking  flashman is supposed to be a big strapping fellow   neverheless reed was excellent as bismarck  what kills the film is that it is made as a comedy  the only scene in which it creates the true atmosphere of the book is the scene in which flashman kills de gautet  tom bell   a great shame  as the production values  costumes  sets etc are superb and the casting is generally excellent   just about everybody in the film is well cast apart from malcolm mcdowell  possibly the directorship of richard lester was responsible for the way the film is  as a recent radio adaptation of  flash for freedom   adapted by mr fraser  worked quite well  perhaps one day we may see flashman done justice on screen,0,1,0.6383445732675931
the often reliable leonard maltin says this is a  delightful romance  and that sanders is  superb   maltin must have confused this movie with something else  sanders is snide and droll and superb  as usual    you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery   sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three    but dull  wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately  the storyline itself  an autobiography with sanders as a suave jewel thief  francois eugene vidocq  who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels  is entertaining enough  but it has the same kind of hollow historical hollywood treatment that marred such period epics as  marie antoinette   and certainly the deplorable  forever amber   which screams for a classy remake   though  in his defense  sanders tries mightily to add some depth to his character  it is all for naught  i am an unabashed douglas sirk fan  but this is 1946  and it is one of sirk s earliest american efforts  lacking many of the signature touches that would define his florid  breast heaving potboilers  sirk is just getting his feet wet here  and made a number of unmemorable films over the next ten years until he struck gold with  magnificent obsession   and hit his stride  bombarding us with such estrogen fests as  all that heaven allows    written on the wind   and  imitation of life   but  scandal in paris  is hardly his best work   a relatively low budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costuming,0,1,0.7448948585792966

it s unlikely that anyone except those who adore silent films will appreciate any of the lyrical camera work and busy  but scratchy  background score that accompanies this 1933 release  although sound came into general use in 1928  there are not_more than fifty words spoken to tell the story of a woman  unhappily married  who deserts her husband for a younger man after a romantic interlude in the woods the most vividly photographed scene has the jealous husband giving a lift to the young man for a ride into town  proceeding to drive normally until he realizes the man is his wife s lover  in a frenzy of jealousy  he drives at top speed toward a railroad crossing but changes his mind at the last moment  losing his nerve  it s probably the most tension filled scene in the otherwise decidedly slow moving and obviously contrived story hedy lamarr is given the sort of close up treatment lavished on marlene dietrich by her discoverer  but her beauty had not_yet been refined by the cosmeticians as they were when she was transported to hollywood  her performance consists mostly of looking sad and morose while mourning the loss of her marriage with only brief glimpses of a smile when she finds her true love  aribert mog   the handsome young stud who retrieves her clothes after a nude swim the swimming scene is very brief  discreetly photographed  and not_worth all the heat it apparently generated  the love making scene  later on  is also artfully photographed with the sort of lyrical photography evident throughout most of the film  artfully so  more is left to the imagination with the use of symbolism  and this is the sort of thing that has others proclaiming the film is some kind of lyrical masterpiece not_so  it s disappointing  primitively crude in its sound portions  including the laborious symphonic music in the background  and certainly miss lamarr is fortunate that louis b  mayer saw the film and on the basis of it  gave her a career in hollywood  he must have seen something in her work that i didn t it s apparent that this was conceived as a silent film with the camera doing all the work  the jarring  workers  scene at the conclusion goes on for too long and is a jarring intrusion where none is needed  it fails to end the film on the proper note,0,1,0.6952963415274562

ok  let me again admit that i haven t seen any other merchant ivory  the distributor  films  nor have i seen more celebrated works by the director  so my capacity to discuss before the rains outside of analysis of the film itself is mitigated  with that admittance  let me begin before the rains is a different kind of movie that doesn t know which genre it wants to be  at first  it pretends to be a romance  in most romances  the protagonist falls in love with a supporting character  is separated from the supporting character  and is  sometimes  united with his or her partner  this movie s hero has already won the heart of his lover but cannot be with her  his name is henry moores and her name is sajani  and they reside in southern india during the waning days of the raj  british imperial rule   henry has been away from london for a long time and has fallen in love with his married indian maid  despite his legal marriage and child overseas  what could be better than that  they often sneak away for intimate afternoons until some children notice them  word spreads to sajani s husband who questions her involvement with moores  she denies any contact with him  but moores asks her to leave the area  sajani refuses because of her devotion to him and commits suicide  please take note that these events occur in the opening third of the film  the film changes tone and becomes a crime drama in its final portions sajani s body is discovered right as moores  family comes to visit  the alleged perpetrator is moores s english educated assistant t k  t k  knows of his master s affair but keeps silent until his life becomes threatened  once he is declared innocent  he attempts to regain his honor by killing moores  t k  is too squeamish and leaves him in a dirt path as the rains fall i want to warn you  this isn t a romance film  the dvd cover and theatrical posters show an indian woman and caucasian man embracing in an idealized tropic setting  this image is captured directly from the film s opening  but quickly disappears  then it s over  it seems like an effort to capitalize on western fixation on forbidden love  it isn t effective  at all  not_is the movie not_a romance  but its characters lack any personality  they are bundles of walking clichés  moores is an arrogant white man who doesn t recognize his indian friend  t k  s intelligence  t k  is torn between his own heritage and his educative background  sajani is a woman incapable of having a choice in her romantic life  oh  and  of course  moores  family is inquisitive into sajani s death but still slightly racist to indians  if the tone wasn t so serious  i would be willing to overlook these problems  but it isn t  the film is presented with a didactic overtone which highlights its poor character development not_this film isn t terrible  other than the laughable screenplay  it isn t poor  the actors are all experienced and perform well here  nandita das  who plays sajani  was part of wonderful indian drama water  even director sivan has an impressive resume  he recently oversaw the terrorist  which is part of roger ebert s  great movies  collection  what happened here  why is this movie so bad  well  sivan mentioned how he was inspired to direct this film because of a short he viewed in israel called red roofs  apparently  the story was  timeless   and sivan sought to create a similar experience set in 1930 s india  i don t have any problem with that approach  but i think sivan may have been too motivated this time  the actors  cinematography  and set design are acceptable but unless you share sivan s aura  you ll probably not_enjoy it  my recommendation is that you presume you aren t in accordance with him and watch something else  final consensus   and ½ out of,0,1,0.5417263229077235

well i just gave away 95 minutes and 47 seconds that i ll not_get back on this piece of trash  i heard someone online describe this movie s villains as  subhuman cannibals   and i thought it was promising because i thought it would be like the descent  wrong  the descent was a psychological thriller with dynamic characters and strong storyline  these villains are totally unrealistic and not_part of their performance is enjoyable to watch  this movie isn t so controversial  i ve seen this level of gore in many films  this movie plain sucks  synopsis  a blonde who thinks she s real hot  but she isn t   her admirer  and her admirer s friend  not_i don t remember their names  go into the woods  their car breaks down  they are warned to leave by a man named mark  the blonde gets unreasonably hysterical and the next morning they can t find the admirer s friend  admirer impales his foot  whoops    don t worry  he is much more upset when his car won t start than when he gets impaled by nails  after a nanosecond of coaxing  the blond leaves to find help  events ensue that i cannot remember  during this and throughout the movie  we are shown grotesque torture scenes with not_substance including one that made me gag  blonde goes to save admirer from house of cannibals  even though all they are seen eating is intestines  which would logically be the last choice for real cannibals to eat since they contain actual food   blonde finds admirer hurt and works very hard  unsuccessfully  to work up tears  then you get a good laugh when the blonde is in the house and announces she can  out think them   mark  the man who warned them to leave  has a remarkable change of character when he reveals the cannibals are his family  then there is some shooting  they leave the house  the shooting continues  then a random guy shows up and says he s been watching them  before he is shot  we are shown an acid trip inspired scene of more killing  the blonde or her admirer shoots him because he did not_help them  there s more killing  the admirer professes his love for the blonde  then a mysterious hand covers the camera  what does that imply  i don t know  hopefully not_a sequel,0,1,0.44325696652270186

probably the only thing that got the movie up to a four for me is the fact that i love peter falk  one of the world s great portrayers of bumbling incompetence       and yet he is one of the only anchors that prevents this from being a chaotic disaster  as pops romano  he provides a respectable mix of gangster charm and straight man to chris kattan s manic foolishness  respectable performances are also offered by richard roundtree as the harried boss  vinessa shaw as a talented female fbi agent bouncing her head off a glass ceiling and fred ward as falk s advisor and benedict arnold the plot concept actually has some wonderful possibilities and  in the hands of a young steve martin or chevy chase  could have proved a great comedic vehicle  kattan  who seems to idolize ernest or pee wee herman  just provides a muddled mess  sadly  peter berg and chris penn  who portray his misfit brothers  both fall far short of their proven capability there are some very funny scenes  but they are far too few and separated by way too many boring ones  what i truly miss here is what always attracted me to the leslie neilsen movies  there is not_second level  of wit riding over the slapstick  not_cultural references that only the adults get    not_double entendre    it is just silly and  by the way  this doesn t all mean that i am recommending it for your 9 year old  because hopefully they have better taste and less fascination with some of their body parts and their functions,0,1,0.3747767301020431
while it contains facts that are not_reported  it is not_the truth  they took a lot of liberties in rearranging events  excluding people  and using sets that do not_meet the facts of their lives in the 30 s  there were more than just bonnie  clyde  and w d  in the gang at various times  and those people had as much to do with the facts as those included  buck and blanche went to convince clyde to go straight much earlier than the one shootout  and in fact got drawn back into crime  some of the events that were portrayed in daylight actually took place at night  bonnie s wound was much more severe and not_healed right  it was so bad she had to be carried around by someone until it healed up  and even then it stiffened up so she walked stiffly  clyde also walked with a limp because while in prison he cut off a big toe  i know  i m being nit picky  and it was a tv movie  but even without these factual errors in this  true  story  the movie moves too fast from event to event and comes across more as several separate snapshots of their lives  rather than being a cohesive flowing story i d recommend reading a book or seeing a documentary if you want to get closer to the truth,0,1,0.5279014175917452

robert colomb has two full time jobs  he s known throughout the world as a globetrotting tv reporter  less well known but equally effortful are his exploits as a full time philanderer i saw  vivre pour vivre  dubbed in english with the title  live for life   some life  robert seems to always have at least three women in his life  one mistress on her way out  one on her way in  and the cheated wife at home  it helps that robert is a glib liar  among his most useful lies are  i ll call you tomorrow  and  my work took longer than planned   he spends a lot of time and money on planes  trains and hotel rooms for his succession of liaisons  you wonder when this guy will get caught with his pants down some may find his life exciting  but i thought it to be tedious  his companions  including his wife  catherine  are all attractive and desirable women  but his lifestyle is so hectic and he is so deceitful  you wonder if he s enjoying all this adding to the tedium is considerable footage that doesn t further the plot  there are extended sections with not_dialogue or french only dialogue  we see documentaries of wars  torture  and troop training interspersed with the live action  when robert s flight returns from africa  we wait and wait for the plane to land and taxi to the airport terminal annie girardot is the standout performer in this film  hers was the most interesting character and she played it to perfection  it was also nice to see candice bergen at the beginning of her career  i can t find fault with yves montand s performance of what was basically an amoral bum i enjoyed some of claude lelouch s novel techniques  in a hotel room scene  the camera pans around the room as robert and his mistress argue  we catch sight of them briefly during each pass around the room  in another scene set on a sleeping car of a train  robert is lying on the upper bunk while his wife is on the lower  robert is giving his wife some important but distressing news  but we hear only parts of it because of the clatter of the train  i sensed that his wife was also unable to absorb every word due to the shocking nature of the news  i also liked the exciting safari scenes in africa  the cinematography of those scenes and of those in amsterdam was superb i reviewed this movie as part of a project at the library of congress  i ve named the project fifty  50 notable films forgotten within 50 years  as best i can determine  this film  like the other forty nine i ve identified  has not_been on video  telecast  or distributed in the u s  since its original release  in my opinion  it is worthy of being made available again,0,1,0.6357042813785238
i found this film to be an interesting study in cause and effect but little more than that  the basic plot follows the lives of a handful of people and how their actions  deliberate and otherwise  effect the lives of the others  the film s premise holds great promise but i feel it fails to deliver on its promise  too much time is spent telling the audience about chaos theory and too little time actually showing it  as a result  i not_got a true feel for any of the characters and not_made a good connection with them emotionally  by the end of the movie  i had a  so what  attitude about all of them  a stronger direction in character development would have made this movie great  but as it stands it is merely so so,0,1,0.6935443406517146

i m starting to think that there s a conspiracy  all right  one that involves a wallop of money paid to those who have access to published columns in newspapers and film and art magazines to ensure that this or that film  despite its obscurity  will reach a higher status via a ratings point which will tag it with a  universal acclaim  or something within that range  thus ensuring unsuspecting folk  like me  will wander into theatres or rent the bloody thing  expecting a surprise  only to find myself racing to the bathroom to upchuck this movie is one of them  it has definitely make me bypass any and every posted article i come across because it s rather clear that two things might have happened  either i didn t get the message that is so hidden beneath this film s inner realms as to be impossible to access  or they and i watched two entirely different movies that happen to share the same name  4 is a dirty trick on the audience  it s not_wonder that it appeared and disappeared faster than you can say  smorsgabord  and that despite the rating it got on metacritic  not_one had heard of it  it s terrible with sugar on top firstly  there is the ever present number four from start to finish  while having a little symbolism here and there is okay  and it s been done with various degrees of success in many well known movies  this movie is panting with it  four dogs at the start of the movie  looking at the camera in a heretofore empty street when suddenly  machinery drops onto the foreground and proceeds to rip open the asphalt  four people in a bar  although one of them is a non entity  three of them go their separate ways but are linked nevertheless  not_to each other but to what their lives are not_while this concept may work  the movie meanders so much    particularly with the story of the would be model played by marina vovchenko which goes into the territory of the extremely bizarre  and not_in a good way    that the initial theme gets lost in translation  or maybe  like i said before  i just  didn t get it   the problem also lies in that so much time is spent on marina s story  which revolves on the death of her sister  from bread chewing  not_less  and the subsequent  shrill mourning which follows  that any interest in the inherent surrealism dissipates without a trace  so what if the same horrifying tales that the three strangers interchanged in a bar seem to have a truth of their own  the director doesn t invest much time in truly tying them together  or weaving a tighter story that could  in a david lynchian way  intersect either with the past present  or within alternate dimensions  or even as a straightforward  mundane science fiction story  this is an uphill battle against an insurmountable wall that only a saint  or someone into the weird for weird s sake  could endure,0,1,0.4182574640084725
thankfully he hasn t  yet  this is crude  simplistic student politics made into drama  it needs the viewer to buy into a series of conceits  conceit 1  that a british electorate could be swung from being basically right of centre to being overwhelmingly far left  conceit 2  that all debate in the media and the general public is unanimously ended and that the new prime minister s only critics are sinister civil servants  mi5  big business and the americans  naturally   conceit 3  that this radical socialist pm can solve all union  economic and social problems with consummate ease in a way that unites the nation  conceit 4  that severing all ties with the us and nato is a good thing  conceit 5  that the soviet union isn t a brutal and oppressive regime and that we should have had closer times with them back in the 80 s  and finally  conceit 6  that the reactionary forces of the us would actively seek to launch a coup d etat against britain it s ludicrous and the show only gained the reputation that it did by trying to cash in on some anti thatcher feeling in the country and having left wing tv critics singing its praises  when it was made  television was still a hugely popular and influential medium with shows getting huge ratings so a widely talked about drama with a hint of controversy had a good chance of getting a big audience  ray mcinally s performance was great  which is one of the few plus points  history and time has shown the huge weakness in the premise and plot of this show,0,1,0.6180590513011078

what does the   executive producer   do in a movie   if i remember correctly it s the person who raised the financial backing to make the movie   you might notice in a great number of movies starring sean connery that he is also the executive producer which meant connery himself raised the money since he is a major player   unfortunately it should also be pointed out that a great number of movies   starring sean connery were solely made because he managed to raise the money since he s a major hollywood player   it s usually an indication that when the credits read that the executive producer and the star of the movie are one and the same the movie itself is nothing more than a star vehicle with the story screenplay not_being up to scratch protocol follows the saga of one sunny davis a kooky bimboesque cocktail waitress who saves a visiting dignitary and as a reward gets made a top diplomat   likely   as things progress ms davis   who has problems being able to string two sentences together   finds herself in more outlandish and less likely situations   when i say that protocol stars goldie hawn who is also the film s executive producer do you understand what i m saying about the story screenplay not_being up to scratch   exactly,0,1,0.3895788398537814

the film gives a rather condensed version of what is contained in the book  which as far as i can tell by doing some research and investigative fact checking is largely a work of fiction  in reality  there are not_ancient scrolls and if the author was hard pressed i m sure he d have to admit he s not_laid eyes on any scrolls in ancient aramaic found in peru  these  valuable  texts written as usual by anonymous  were destroyed by the evil  truth haters  in the church and in the local government  that s rather strange  as all kinds of new age crap comes out each year   hundreds of books  dozens of movies  and the roman catholic church doesn t seem to me to be hell bent on destroying the movement which it probably views as i do  a total crock of doody  i m not_fan of the church  mind you  but at least the ancient texts which they base their faith on are real it s a typical pattern of scam artists and religious hucksters to claim to have seen or translated ancient documents which unfortunately got destroyed by  evil  men or in joseph smith s case  got taken back to heaven once translated  therefore  the actual texts cannot be found in any museums like the smithsonian  nor the translations checked by specialists in ancient languages like coptic or aramaic  it s a scam  in one sense  i admire anybody smart enough to come up with a great idea and make millions off it  but i couldn t do it myself  as i ve not_desire to mislead the public with more new agey hokum occasionally  a genuine ancient text does get found hidden away and lost for years  the gospel of judas  a gnostic text  was discovered and after carbon dating and diligent study of the text  deemed authentic by experts  the gospel of judas was referenced as heretical around 300 c e   not_church documents from that time mention any celestine prophecies as authentic  heretical or anything else we are evolving towards something  that much is true   but the optimism in the celestine prophecy is based on nothing but fiction and lies  and a philosophy built on a foundation of lies  like a castle built on sand will collapse  the harsh  ugly  overpopulated  cruel world of blade runner is more likely what it ll be like over the horizon  than some utopian hippie commune where all is love and peace  i tell people the truth and they hate me  but tell them what they want to hear  even if pure piffle  and one can make millions  the celestine prophecy is what the world wants to hear  too bad it is a castle built on sand  don t get me wrong  i wish to god  the celestine vision was reality  only it s not_no ancient philosophy at any time expressed ideas given in the insights with the modern concept of spiritual evolution going hand in hand with biological evolution  these new agey ideas did not_exist in the ancient world and did not_exist until darwininan evolution became well known  that means the ideas in the celestine prophecies cannot be older than the 1800s c e  and do not_go back to the early b c e period or near the time of jesus of nazareth  this type of claim by new agers is not_at all unusual  wiccans claim their brand of magic and witchcraft    the  old religion  goes back to the stone age  when in reality not_book of shadows has ever been known to exist prior to gerald gardner who lived in the 1900s and was the buddy of aleister crowley new age gurus tell lies and claim their ideas are based on ancient teachings  when the ancients would thumb their noses at such absurdities that are preached by gurus today  why do they do what they do  perpetrate such fraud  simple  there are millions of dollars to be made  and the modern guru acquires power over his or her followers  they compete fiercely and have a strong hatred for their competition despite their claims of love for all things  each new age group bitter opposes the others  it s a struggle for your minds and your wallets but learn one thing from me  that is actually similar to one of the insights  learn to follow your own instincts and look for guidance from within  that i can agree with wholeheartedly,0,1,0.4721093481090273
i just saw this movie  and i have to say that it was a big waste of time  the girl who played eva  ellen fjaestad  can t act at all  she read her lines very un naturally  and she had a very un natural facial expression through the entire movie  rosanna munter who played petra on the other hand  is a natural  she played her part with great perfection spoilers  the story was simple   we ve seen it many  many times before  she breaks up  he finds another  she get jealous  he breaks up with the other girl and they end up back together in the end  there were not_surprises at all  one knew that eva would break up  and that adam would  hook up  with petra  the only thing that nobody saw coming was that petra told adam to go after eva at the party  she became all serious  which is a side of petra the viewers hadn t seen earlier in the movie  and told him to win eva s heart back  which was really cute besides rosanna munter  there isn t a single actor who gives a memorable performance this is a mediocre movie with mediocre actors  so i don t recommend it,0,1,0.6312600833579741

how the grinch stole christmas was a wonderful little christmas cartoon that anyone could easily enjoy  i not_did see the reason for a remake  not_to mention a remake that was made with humans  the cartoon was just perfect enough  what s the purpose of this film  but it also seemed a little odd for jim carrey to be the grinch  i mean he s a great comedic actor  but him as the grinch  it just didn t make any sense to me  his performance was a little over the top and unintentionally laughable at moments  not_to mention some of the added dialog was a bit childish and not_enjoyable  the whole story of the grinch and cindy lou who was over done and wasn t needed  they actually just destroyed the story  period all the who s in whoville are getting ready for their best christmas season yet where everything is intended to go perfectly  but cindy lou who is curious and worried about the grinch that lives above them and that he s not_going to get as good of a christmas as the other who s  he kicks her out and decides that he doesn t want christmas this year and that in fact he should just steal christmas all together to show the who s what his version of christmas is all about  but soon he realizes that the who s may know that it s a little bit more than what is the materialized version of christmas how the grinch stole christmas wasn t needed and was a bit over the top  i really recommend that you stick with the cartoon just for the simple fact that this is a pretty disturbing version  at least in my opinion  the make up and presentation of the whole film was just a bit over done  not_to mention that how the grinch stole christmas  was more meant to be as a cartoon rather than a version starring jim carry  but at least this version makes you grateful for the boris karloff version that is played every christmas 1 10,0,1,0.54008504788024

woody allen has made some of the greatest comedies ever and i would seriously consider saying that annie hall is the greatest movie ever but if i really think about it i will probably think of one or two that are better  but it would be hard  he has had of course some films that aren t quite good but not_that bad either like manhattan murder mystery and sweet and lowdown but he has not_before had a film quite as bad as melinda and melinda  not_quite so tired and so unfunny  his films are usually witty and hilarious but how did this happen  is it still our good old woody  the plot runs around four friends who are having dinner together  two are play writers and one of the others mentions a funny story that happened to a friend of hers  it is about a young woman who bursts in on a dinner party unexpected  we not_hear the rest because the two play writes start to debate whether it would make a better comedy or tragedy  than we begin to see the two points of view  both center on this woman named melinda who is having trouble both with drugs and with her ex husband  in the tragedy she is an old family friend who after attempting suicide decided to show up at her old best friends front door for not_apparent reason  the comedy is about melida who stumbles in on the dinner party after popping 28 sleeping pills  both go on a wild whirl wind of events that not_make sense or fit together  or make you laugh more than once or twice  there are some nice performances by radha mitchell and will ferrell but they can t fit it together on there own  they cam t stop it from sinking farther down than most of the other films this year,0,1,0.5480878955498608

universal s answer to  the exorcist  isn t a very good one  unfortunately  the film offers bland  unimaginative direction from michael winner who wastes an outstanding cast with a screenplay massing crater sized plot holes  not_to mention  it s unbearably silly not_explaining certain key elements within the story model cristina raines moves into a high rise owned by the catholic church with a creepy  blind priest john carradine  who holes up in there always at the window  she begins to suffer faint spells and nausea  what s worse is tenants she meets in the building such as burgess meredith with a cat and a canary  and a young beverly d angelo as a lesbian  ava gardner looking great at 55 is the realtor who showed raines the place  cristina s lover is chris sarandon  whose wife  committed suicide  after finding out they were having an affair  josé ferrer has a small role as the  priest of the brotherhood  who informs monsignor arthur kennedy to be careful as he heads to the very high rise not_housing carradine but raines as well  sarandon sends a hired hand up to the high rise one night to check out a certain room above cristina s apartment where she heard metallic clanging and other loud racket  he winds up dead the very same night cristina  kills  her dead father in a nightmare  screaming mad on the street  cristina does indeed have blood on her which leads police detective eli wallach and partner christopher walken to investigate them with sure certainty that it all somehow leads back to sarandon who is a hot shot lawyer who once beat the cop in court regarding the whole wife s suicide  that case is really a motivating factor is wallach s dogged approach to finding out whose blood was really on cristina and if sarandon has anything to do with it  you also have martin balsam as a professor who understands this type of latin cristina mysteriously understands and unbilled actors such as jeff goldblum as a fashion photographer and tom berenger as a man interested in this certain room that has become available in the very room now renovated that cristina once stayed in  what bothers me more than anything is lack of explanation  towards the end of the film wallach and walken are forgotten and we are left wondering why they just up and quit investigating  their characters are just left on the back burner  how the priests know that  now is the time  when a certain man will die and must be replaced to guard a certain gate in that high rise and why cristina suffers through the trauma she does isn t adequately explained  how certain ghosts just appear to cristina and disappear when she tries to show gardner the rooms they occupied during a cat s birthday see for yourself isn t adequately explained  not_to mention gardner s role in the grand scheme of things  she brings people to that high rise  but what is really her reasons in the film  it seems like this film should ve been longer and cleared things up left lost to a rushed conclusion that is just laughable when it should be scary,0,1,0.4108102222019394

mabel at the wheel is one of those movies with a behind the scenes story that s more interesting than the movie itself  this was chaplin s tenth comedy for keystone during his year of apprenticeship  and his first two reeler  here he played one of his last out and out villain roles  although the feature length tillie s punctured romance was yet to come   and it also marked one of the last times he would work for a director other than himself  in fact  chaplin s conflicts with director and co star mabel normand almost got him fired from the studio chaplin hadn t gotten along with his earlier directors  henry lehrman and george nichols  but according to his autobiography having to take direction from a mere  girl  was the last straw  charlie and mabel argued bitterly during the making of this film  chaplin was still a newcomer at keystone and his colleagues didn t know what to make of him  but everyone loved mabel  producer mack sennett was on the verge of firing chaplin when he learned that the newcomer s films were catching on and exhibitors wanted more of them a s a p   so chaplin was promised the chance to direct himself in return for finishing this movie the way mabel wanted it unfortunately  none of that drama is visible on screen in mabel at the wheel  which looks like typical keystone chaos  the story concerns an auto race in which mabel s beau  harry mccoy  is scheduled to compete  but wicked charlie and his henchmen abduct the lad  and mabel must take the wheel in his place  for all the racing around  brick hurling and finger biting the film is frankly short on laughs  but there are a few points of interest  there s some good cinematography and editing in the race sequence  though there aren t really any gags  just lots of frantic activity  chaplin himself looks odd  sporting a goat like beard on his chin and wearing the top hat and frock coat he wore in his very first film appearance  making a living  but the outfit suits the old fashioned villainy he displays throughout  at least it s novel to watch him play such an uncharacteristic role  visible in the stands at the race track are such keystone stalwarts as chester conklin  edgar kennedy in a strangely dandified get up  and a more characteristic mack sennett  spitting tobacco and doing his usual mindless rube routine  as a performer  sennett was about as subtle as the movies he produced  but you have to give the guy credit  he knew what people liked  these films were hugely popular in their day  mack s performance doesn t add much to mabel at the wheel  but he probably had to be on hand for the filming of this one to make sure his stars didn t kill each other,0,1,0.4139522222590301

possible spoilers although there was some good acting   particularly chloe sevigny  and radha mitchell in the comedy half   this simply was not_an engaging film  the segues between the comedy part and the tragedy part were awkward or sometimes not_obvious  this viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast differs in the two halves  i thought with the way things were laid out in the opening scene that the people surrounding melinda would be the same people  just reacting differently  more of a  he said  she said  premise   however  what we have is two totally different stories and two totally different women  both of whom happen to be played by radha mitchell the two playwrights in the opening scene   the comedian and the tragedian   supposedly take the same premise and go from there  but the two stories are only tenuously related  they do little to support the topic of discussion  which is that almost anything can be looked at as either comedy or tragedy  nice cast  but a disappointing film,0,1,0.37240977267655473

as to the level of wit on which this comedy operates  barely even reaching feature length   can i do it     till i need glasses  is a collection of  mostly  dirty jokes  many of them are so short that you can t believe it when you realize that that was supposed to be the punchline  example  the santa claus gag   others are so long that you can t believe it when you realize that they needed so much time to set up that punchline  example  the students  awards gag   and nearly all are directed without any artistry  don t get me wrong  about 1 every 10 jokes actually manages to be funny  the iron   phone one is probably my favorite   there is also some wonderful full frontal nudity that proves  yet again  that the female body  especially in its natural form  is the best thing on this planet  there is some comedic male nudity as well   and i agree with others that the intentionally stupid title song is actually pretty damn catchy  but none of those reasons are enough to give this film anything more than   out of 4,0,1,0.4388532769996397

the only redeeming quality of this overlong miscast melodrama is the scenery of southern france and the voice of nana mascouri singing the theme song  stephanie powers is miscast and betrayed by a phony accent  as has been pointed out  she is too old to play an 18 year old and looks far too young as a grandmother with a college age granddaughter  lee remick is good although she also is ageless in her later years  the talented joanna lumley is under utilized and also manages to look forever young when her middle aged son  robert urich  finally marries grandma stephanie powers  stacey keach s ceaseless arrogance makes you wonder what these women saw in him  don t know how any viewer could relate to his excessive portrayal  the most credible performance is given by ian richardson  who makes the rest of the cast look like rank amateurs  it strains credulity that the handsome male suitors in this epic would remain ever single while they patiently await the subject of their affections to finally consent to accept them  can anybody believe that handsome robert urich would remain single for decades waiting for stephanie powers to finally accept his endless marriage proposals  the ww2 engagement between the wehrmacht and the marquis is laughable  to begin with  the germans did not_occupy the provence section of france until late in the war  it was controlled by the vichy french puppet government  we see the french resistance staging a daylight raid on mistral s villa to steal sheets after which they all lounge under a bridge waiting for a lumbering truckload of nazi troops to surprise and annihilate them  if you want to see a well acted mini series set in a foreign country  don t watch mistral s daughter  a far better alternative would be the thorn birds,0,1,0.4393254128101993

while it does crack the odd good joke  the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokes unlike what an other comment says i don t think this is the best rte have ever made  its really dry and sarcastic  sarcasm is the lowest form of wit  there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud  people seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which aren t really that good  overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often it can be fairly mediocre  its not_as good as jasper carrot or dave allens stuff  i find benny hill funnier,0,1,0.48588583969028776
1914 was an amazing year for charlie chaplin  it was his first year in films and he appeared in more than 30 films  while most of these films weren t particularly good  they did give him a chance to slowly evolve his screen persona  however  by this film  the familiar  little tramp  character was still in development  sure charlie looked the part  but his character still lacked the sweetness and decency that he later developed  instead  chaplin often hit  kicked or did other nasty things to people for seemingly not_reason at all as for this very slight film  it is interesting to watch for the cast  while they are not_familiar today  chaplin stars along with mabel normand  chester conklin and mack swain  all exceptionally popular stars with keystone films  the problem with this film is that while it has a few nice scenes  the plot seems very vague and improperly developed  chester and mabel got to the race track  a very common theme in keystone productions  it must have been located near a race track   charlie and mack show up and sneak in  mack is chased by the police for doing this while charlie slaps chester around and steals his girl  in the end  for not_apparent reason  the cops take chester and mack away  leaving charlie with mabel  who  oddly  didn t seem put off by charlie s boorish behaviors  unless you are a huge silent comedy buff or film historian  this is a very forgettable film that is only important in the evolution of chaplin  what he and the other actors actually do on stage  while not_unusual for a keystone film  isn t particularly funny when seen today,0,1,0.5215251949463013

dr  hackenstein begins at the turn of last century   1909 the dawn of modern medical science  to be exact  dr  eliot hackenstein  david muir  is in the early stages of his rejuvenation of living tissue experiments  dr  hackenstein manages to bring a skinned rat back to life which confirms he has succeeded in bringing the dead back to life    it s now  three years later    dean slesinger  micheal ensign  is round the doc s house for dinner  as dean slesinger   dr  hackenstein eat they talk about hackenstien s experiments which dean slesinger has always been opposed to  dr  hackenstein shows dean slesinger his laboratory in his attic where he keeps the severed head of his wife sheila  sylvia lee baker  who died in an unfortunate  accident    can telepathically talk to him  christy botkin provides sheila s voice apparently   dr  hackenstein also show s dean slesinger a skinned chicken running around in a cage   explains that with the process he has developed he will bring sheila back to life  the dean has some sort of seizure   apparently dies  meanwhile sisters wendy  bambi darro as dyanne dirossario    leslie trilling  catherine davis cox  plus their brother alex  john alexis    their cousin melanie victor  stacey travis  are driving along near hackenstein s house when they crash  they seek shelter   assistance   arrive upon hackenstein s doorstep  dr  hackenstein invites the four stranded travellers to stay for the night  later on dr  hackenstein is visited by two grave robbers  xavier  logan ramsey    ruby rhodes  ann ramsey  who deliver a male body when hackenstein actually needs female parts for sheila  dr  hackenstein being the genius that he is decides not_to waste the opportunity of having three young beautiful specimens available   starts to  borrow  the bits  n  pieces he needs to complete sheila   written   directed by richard clark i was pleasantly surprised by dr  hackenstein  i ll state right now that it ain t brilliant by any stretch of the imagination but for what it was i actually quite liked it  it moves at a reasonable pace even if it does tend to drag a little bit during it s middle as things settle down  the script tries to mix slapstick humour like a scene when dr  hackenstein is trying to restrain melanie   she tries to gain the attention of his deaf housekeeper yolanda simpson  catherine cahn  by kicking out   hackenstein keeping melanie behind yolanda s back who is seemingly oblivious to what s happening  with a touch of gore but i d say dr  hackenstein is more of a comedy than horror in conception   feel throughout  there are some tacky puns   sexual innuendo as well which are always good for a laugh  dr  hackenstein to wendy  would you like to see my instruments  as an example  i also thought the scene when mrs trilling  phyllis diller  reports her missing daughter s to the bemused detective olin  william schreiner  was a pretty amusing sequence going round in circle s talking about why he isn t looking for them even though he has only just been told  why the cell doesn t have a prisoner in it   that if he didn t find the cousin not_to worry about it  none of it s flat laugh out loud but i must admit i found myself smiling on occasion   found the film as whole to be quietly amusing  there isn t a lot of on screen gore  a few severed limbs  sheila s decapitated head  some medical stitching   those skinned animals which are definitely fake by the way  i liked the characters in dr  hackenstein too  which was surprise in itself  the acting isn t brilliant but to give everyone credit they put some effort into it  lots of exaggerated facial movements   some serious overacting means it s not_dull  oh   the three birds in dr  hackenstein are fit if you know what i mean  technically the film is ok as well  once again it ain t going to win any oscars but i have to give the filmmakers at least some credit for trying to pull off a turn of the century period setting  it doesn t always work  the clothes are at odds with each other at times  the girls look like their from victorian england while the guys look like their from a western  the house looks as if all the filmmakers did was remove any modern object from the room   stick a few candles in there  it comes across as a little bit on the cheap side but it really isn t a bad looking film at all considering  could have done without the comedy music though  overall i ended up enjoying dr  hackenstein much more than i thought i would  although that in itself isn t a recommendation  it s certainly is not_the best comedy horror film ever made   it certainly is not_the worst either  a watchable enough piece of harmless fun,0,1,0.37193309012986403

recap  something mysteriously dense that transmits radio signals is discovered in the ice of antarctica  the mysterious block is dug out and brought to a research station on antarctica  julian rome  a former seti worker  is brought in to decipher the message  problem is that one of the researchers is a old girlfriend of his  and the situation quickly turns awkward  especially since the other female researchers practically throw themselves at him  and the block of ice with the thing inside is melting unnaturally quickly  soon the object is in the open  the mystery continues though as the object generates a huge amount of electricity  it is decided to open the object  but just before that is done  julian decodes the signal   do not_open   but too late  and the object explodes as it is finally breached  and two things unleashed on earth  the first is an alien  that had been dormant in the object  and the other is a virus that instantly kills the research staff  and washington  that is suspiciously updated on this historic event  decides that those things can not_be unleashed upon the earth  so a russian nuclear submarine  carrying nuclear weapons is sent to antarctica comments  the movie holds a few surprises  one is carl lewis who surprisingly puts in a good acting performance  and the other is that the special effects that are beautiful  well worked through and a lot better than expected  unfortunately the story holds a lot of surprises of its own  and this time not_in a good way  actually it is so full of plot holes that sometimes the movies seem to consist of almost randomly connected scenes  it is not_explained why washington know so much  why washington is able to command russian submarines  why the object is in the antarctic and has woken up now  it is really puzzling that the alien pod is transmitting in understandable english  some might want to explain this with that the alien had been to earth before and knew the language  and obviously chose english  why    but then it is very confusing why the nice aliens that apparently want to save the earth from the virus  send their  do not_open  message encoded  and finally the end is as open as an end can be the movie is a little entertaining but too much energy  from me  must be diverted to fill in the voids in the plot  therefore the total impression of the movie is not_too good 3 10,0,1,0.43094693028814385
what ever possessed martin scorcese to remake this film  and not_did he remake it  completely ruin it  the nonsensical decision to make the character played by robert deniro  in his most overdone performance  and that s saying a lot  into a religious fanatic is ridiculous  and exemplary of attitudes harbored by hollywood  and mr  scorcese especially   attitudes that compel writers to think that the best way to make a character insane is to tattoo a crucifix on his back  in any case  this movie is awful,0,1,0.3979988240608036
this film is really vile  it plays on the urban paranoia of the 70s 80s and puts it into a school context  i m not_saying that urban crime wasn t a problem for a lot of people or that schools weren t aren t problem areas but this vile piece of exploitation takes the biscuit  violence is beyond anything realistically imaginable but in this case it s not_a case of social issues but a white  upper middle class student uses it to turn himself into the crime kingpin of his local high schoiol  and of course he knows how to play the system  does that sound familiar  yes  this turd is pure violent exploitation  a really nasty piece of work  it s disturbing brutality dressed up as a social comment  this belongs in the same category as trash like exterminator  death wish 2 5 and so on and so on  the only remarkable thing is that michael fox was so broke at the time that he had to do stuff like this,0,1,0.4724647162603336

from the beginning this movie did have a few flaws  the main character played by hayden christensen is a the rich young mogul who has inherited his father s considerable wealth and power  and he is struggling to both fill his father s shoes and cut the apron strings mother  and co executive  keeps too tight  he also has the problem of having a heart condition and waiting in the limbo that is the organ donor registry  there are also minor back stories which your first instinct is to mostly ignore that become important later  such as his friendship with his surgeon  terrence howard  and his romance with a middle class girl  jessica alba   uncreative story lines  but not_bad enough to ruin the movie  the only real  oy vey   moment was the name of lena olin s character  overbearing woman named lilith   subtle the surgical scenes are not_at all censored  i appreciated that  people who find surgery scenes scary might not_the horror of being awake during anesthesia was done well at first  you watch in emotional agony as christensen screams inwardly through the chest incision and the rib spreader  the moment of irony from the trailers then comes where while he is one of the unlucky few to be awake during anesthesia  he is also luck in that it helps him learn that his surgical team is planning to murder him the big twist  however  is very predictable and sends the film delving into the conspiracy and his memories of the little signs which were there but he  like us  initially missed  there are two more twists at the end involving his relationship with his mother  one is an impressive gesture by olin  which comes of as unimpressive due to poor writing  the other is a secret about the family s past which seemed very tacked on and pointless the initially well done anesthesia awareness drama gets lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama  there is a one final attempt to bring it back which falls flat  taking the entire movie with it,0,1,0.42062566586638866

i loved watching the original azumi with its mix of live action manga  compelling storyline  cool soundtrack  directing  kitamura rocks    editing  and not_to mention the beautiful aya ueto who filled the part perfectly  so i was really looking forward to seeing azumi 2  but after finally seeing it i felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket   azumi 2 picks up where azumi left off  however these are completely 2 different movies  the pace is a lot slower  the action is not_as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not_a lot of character development  this was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the toho monster franchise  if that is possible    i agree with some other past reviewers who say that this was a lost opportunity  if only ryuhei kitamura continued with this installment  there is however some beautiful japanese forest scenery to look at while the slow action unfolds and we are introduced all too briefly to bit characters who quickly get killed off  even the real bad guys  get killed off too easily without too much of a fight  the fight with the spider guy  straight out of an episode of monkey   in the bamboo forest was about the only memorable fight scene  wheras in azumi 1 we had a climactic fight scene with barrel camera effects  azumi 2 brought us the azumi cape cam   azumi s rampage at the end was unconvincing  but aya still does an okay job  she looks great in the cape   but where did she get it from  i don t think i will be watching this one over and over again     what a pity,0,1,0.3992687239226542

it appears that many critics find the idea of a woody allen drama unpalatable   and for good reason  they are unbearably wooden and pretentious imitations of bergman  and let s not_kid ourselves  critics were mostly supportive of allen s bergman pretensions  allen s whining accusations to the contrary notwithstanding  what i don t get is this  why was allen generally applauded for his originality in imitating bergman  but the contemporaneous brian depalma was excoriated for  ripping off  hitchcock in his suspense horror films  in robin wood s view  it s a strange form of cultural snobbery  i would have to agree with that,0,1,0.3718933009345573
it is not_obvious from viewing this film  so i recommend viewers research the people who present their case in it  but this presentation on the realities of islam  and its encouragement of violence and intolerance against all non muslims is lacking objectiveness  and also completely fails to factor in the human condition  it is one thing to document that the koran says many things about how a devout muslim is required to interact with non muslims  but any realist is able to realize that not_every human who feels himself or herself to be a follower of islam  will agree with and comply with all tenets of that faith and system  there is reason to call much about the presenters into question  such that viewers need to see the presentation with a healthy skepticism  don t swallow it all  hook  line  and sinker  without some thinking of your own one specific  for instance  is researching the person walid shoebat  who claims to be a former muslim who perpetrated an act of terrorism in bethlehem  there are many wise people in the world who believe neither of these assertions  i am not_nor have i ever been a muslim  i have not_read the koran  i am not_a christian  nor a member of _any_ faith  but i am an intelligent and discerning human  while the film is quite disturbing  in its presentation of how some muslims view their obligation to islam  i remind you that there is more to islam than the views of the fundamentalists  just as their are fundamentalists and evangelical christians  so  too  there are variations in the intensity of belief and obligation among jews and muslims when you watch this film  you need to have the salt shaker on hand  one grain will not_be enough  you ll need more  please use your own mind and think for yourself  research what is presented  and evaluate the state of the world and how islam fits within it based on more than what is said in 98 minutes of video  there is a common thread of political affiliation among those who put this film together  indicating a definite bias  be your own brain,0,1,0.41640942485698107

this film reminded me so much of  a history of violence  which pretended to be a close study of violence and violent behavior but ended up just being nothing short of a cheap action movie masquerading as some thinking film on violence  dustin hoffman and his new british bride move to a small english town and encounter endless harassment from the local drunks who do nothing but hang at the pub all day and make trouble  don t these men have a job  anyway  dustin takes all he can take and by the end of the film he holds up in his house and fights off each one of the drunk attackers by such gruesome means as boiling whiskey poured over someone  feet being blown off by a shotgun and someones head getting caught in a bear trap  funny that someone would have a need for such a large bear trap in a small british town except maybe put a mans head in it sam peckinpah who made the  wild bunch  which also covered the topic of blood letting violence in which not_one was spared  but it was done with style  and you believed it  straw dogs is not_believable  first of all the location is wrong and does not_work  why place it in england  i would think maybe in some inner city location or a small town in the american south in the 1930 s or something  second it is not_in my view ever really explained clearly why these men are so quick to violence except maybe they got drunk and felt a need to kill hoffman and rape his wife sam peckinpah missed the mark on this one,0,1,0.42895158361229213
hollywood  the home of hype  glamor and the search for profits  is scarcely ruled by spiritual values  and so it comes as not_surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly  better to go farther afield  to the films of bresson  dreyer  rossellini and bergman  for probing depictions of the spirituality    strange cargo  is not_exception  this odd hybrid of adventure film  love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate  that a figure of providence and salvation would work to match verne  clark gable at his most cockily mannered and self regarding  and julie  joan crawford  snarling and spitting out every other word in an attempt to be the queen of tough dames  seems ludicrous at best  is this the patron saint of the star system at work  matching warring egos before sending them off to further penal servitude on the m g m lot  but     there are good supporting performances here  and visually arresting moments  the shadowy prison barracks  the escaping boat by moonlight  or against a painterly cloudscape  julie walking along the seafront as the wind whips up  julie and monsieur pig  peter lorre  bargaining for verne s freedom as the storm builds  an unusually ennobling gay prison romance between two convicts     above all  there is paul lukas s dignified and detached performance as hessler  a murderer who can appreciate cambreau s virtues  yet turns his back on him  in the film s most arresting moment  hessler  having left cambreau  stands outside the cabin  we hear the wind through the jungle  see the shadows on his face  which conveys a moment of fear and self doubt  then he exits into the night  in this moment  hessler achieves an ambiguity  depth and existential strength that none of the other characters manage to achieve  is the film s secret that its deepest sympathies are allied with hessler,0,1,0.6844404719916928

the british public school system did not_evolve solely with the idea of educating the upper classes despite that popular and widespread misconception it was designed to produce administrators and governors civil servants and military men to run the british colonies these people were almost entirely recruited from the middle classes when the public schools had begun to show their worth the scions of the aristocracy were sent to them rather than be educated at home by tutors and governesses as had previously been the case they tended to favour the schools nearer  town  so eton and harrow became particularly popular with that class of parent  the vast majority of public schools took their pupils from lower down the social scale tom brown perhaps the most famous public school pupil ever was the son of a country parson not_a belted earl  thus in late 1960s england a country in the throes of post colonial guilt and shedding the last of its commitments to its former dependants as quickly as harold wilson could slip off his  gannex  mac lindsay anderson s  if  was greeted with cathartic joy by the chattering classes and mild bemusement by everyone else  it must be remembered that the so called  summer of love  was followed by the  october revolution  a non event that left a few policemen in london with bruised heads and the u s  embassy with one or two broken windows but achieved absolutely nothing  so when mr anderson s film reached the cinemas the disgruntled former revolutionaries revelled vicariously in what they saw as mr malcolm mcdowell s glorious victory over an amorphous  them  despite the fact that he was ruthlessly gunned down at the end a fate that would have undoubtedly overtaken them had they succeeded in their attempts to get into the u s embassy  the film told us nothing new about public schools homosexuality bullying cold showers patrician sarcastic teachers silly traditions an all too familiar list  it was declared to be an allegory comparing britain to the corrupt crumbling society represented by the school well nearly forty years on the same schools are still flourishing the british social system has not_changed the  october revolution  has been long forgotten except by those involved on one side or the other and mr anderson has completed his  state of the country  trilogy to not_effect whatsoever  if by any chance you should wish to read a book about schoolboys who did buck the system rather more successfully than mr mcdowell and his friends and furthermore lived to tell the tale find a copy of  stalky   co  written by the man whose much maligned poem  if  lent it s name to mr anderson s film a man born in colonial india a man whose work is quietly being airbrushed out of our literary history and do it before the chattering classes succeed in declaring him a non person perhaps somebody should start a revolution about that,0,1,0.5283816967026942
when you see boris karloff and bela lugosi as co stars  you expect to find a well done horror movie  but this was actually quite different  representing as it did what i would describe as an early effort at science fiction  karloff and lugosi both play scientists  rukh and benet respectively    competitors to an extent  until rukh wins benet over with a demonstration that proves his great theory  the science here was   to say the least   a bit rough around the edges  thus science fiction  with the emphasis on the fiction  but somehow rukh harnesses some sort of ray from andromeda that allows him to look at the earth  several thousand million years ago   in that pre historic time  a huge meteorite slammed into africa  leaving deposits of a substance the scientists call  radium x    which can heal and destroy  a large portion of the movie is set rather tediously in africa  on a search for the meteorite deposits  which rukh eventually finds and harnesses to create a great weapon  unfortunately infecting himself with some sort of disease that makes him a great weapon as well karloff and lugosi were both pretty good here  lugosi pulls off a role in which he s the good guy pretty well  although i frankly found him a bit unconvincing   especially during the scenes set in africa  the story also plodded along a bit  and while it held my attention it didn t captivate me  given that this is really a sci fi rather than a horror flick  and that sci fi was in its very early stages  i suppose the movie needs to be cut a bit of slack  it was ok   nothing more  but also nothing less than that  4 10,0,1,0.8154564208124788

this is the most saccharine romance i ever sat through  the perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief  housedress  and ostrich trimmed high heeled mules to watch in the afternoon  lying on the couch eating bonbons  in fact  bonbons play a prominent role in the movie the only reason i was able to watch to the end  is that i finally was able to gaze at keanu reeves  dreamy face in almost every scene  in most of his films  he moves too fast to get a good look  the only rapid action in this show is giancarlo giannini waving his hands with latin emotionality   more italian than mexican  really  the dialog is as stiff as wood  unfortunately  not_bodices are ripped   the hero is disgracefully perfect mannered and mild  the aristocratic warm blooded old world family cliche is as old as the hills  what does it matter if they are irish or italian or mexican  this is a fairy story i knew before the titles finished running that this would not_be the movie i hoped for  the glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in women s day magazine  i didn t see his name listed  but the art director surely was thomas kinkade  who paints the million dollar canvases of irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias  this film was literally seen through rose colored glasses  if you like dreamy pink and blue sky  this film is for you   the bonbons looked really good  too,0,1,0.4934266307482402

a romance without feeling  a drama of issues without point  or drama      this film is supposed to be all these and fails on each and every account  as if it isn t trying  or as if the director editor scriptwriter team isn t really trying  the actors are able  they need better support one element that doesn t fail is the score by george delarue  beautiful and moving  what a shame it s attached to this film  in a good film actors  words and movements and music synchronize and enhance the impact  this editor plastered on music with not_regard for dialogue and movement  the love scene is particularly grating in this respect  an insult to the talents of the lead actors there is another element in the film that works  location photography  notably one moment in grand central station  i d guessed in advance what was going to happen  but how it was filmed in that setting was breathtaking some commentators on this board have pointed out that us assimilation of criminal nazi scientists actually happened during these years of the maccarthy scare  the moment the film seems to start looking seriously at american society  it switches into conventional romance  before any human feelings can move us  it s away on a  predictable   thriller  escapade just as the film insults the talents of the actors  it insults the issues it s pretends  and fails  to take up you are warned,0,1,0.3637652670224427

the thing that stands out in my mind in this film  sadly  is the introduction  where john berlin  andy garcia  is driving into town  you see his mercedes pass on a winding road through a forest that looks like its loaded with redwood trees  it s quite beautiful  as to andy garcia playing a character with the last name of berlin  well   andy is just too hispanic latin for it to be passable  maybe a caucasian father married his spanish mother for this story  who knows  but i can tell you that when you put him in a town of farm folks and hicks  he stands out like a sore thumb  especially with his accent that flares up when he gets angry  yeah  i know  big deal right  he s still a good actor the title concerns a serial killer who nicknames his victims jennifer  all of the victims are blind and he dismembers them  the killer has taken a hiatus but suddenly resurfaces when a blind witness  don t ask  appears  helena robertson  uma thurman   thurman does a good job of playing a blind person  to my surprise  when i saw lance henriksen playing sgt  freddy ross i got worried  henriksen s played in some pretty strange films  especially of late  i still can t forget him in the bloodbath movie  pumpkinhead  berlin movies into a small town from l a  as a detective  he begins investigating the jennifer murders after finding body parts in the local landfill  his brilliance in discovering one of the victims was blind seemed far fetched  so did the irony of  spoiler  freddy s murder  with the recording and name similarities  i got very confused as to the logic of how there came to be eight  jennifers   and the motive of the killer as simply deranged didn t pack much of a punch  in retrospect  this film is probably more true to life in showing an unsuspecting individual as capable of murder simply because they became a little wacko over time or maybe were born looney toons john malkovich does a stupendous job in his interrogation of garcia  albeit not_cop would legally be allowed to press someone that hard and egg them on without rightfully get knocked out  as to the ending  it is a bit of a surprise  but is highly arguable  much like sgt  ross  murder  the killer chooses to walk after his running victim  opting instead to frolick i guess and there are so many opportunities he has in killing her that it s ridiculous  i won t ruin the very end because despite it s shakiness  it s a good surprise  afterward though  you ll probably say  as i did   boy was she lucky   4 10,0,1,0.5173561330538955
is there any other time period that has been so exhaustively covered by television  or the media in general  as the 1960s  not_and do we really need yet another trip through that turbulent time  not_but if we must have one  does it have to be as shallow as  the  60s   i like to think that co writers bill couturie and robert greenfield had more in mind for this two part miniseries than what ultimately resulted  especially given couturie s involvement in the superb hbo movie  dear america  letters home from vietnam  which utilized little original music and not_original footage  letting the sights and sounds of the time speak for themselves  this presentation intercuts file footage with the dramatic production  but it doesn t do anyone any favours by trying to do too much in too little time  like so many of its ilk  it s seen from the point of view of one family  but the children of the family seem to be involved tangentially with almost every major event of the  60s  it s amazing that one of them doesn t go to the rolling stones gig at altamont   making it seem less like a period drama and more like a cliff notes version of the decade the makers rush through it so much that there s little or not_time to give the characters any character  with the stick figures called our protagonists off screen for ages at a time   the children s father is especially clichéd   and then when they re back on blammo  it s something else  garry trudeau could teach the filmmakers a thing or two about doing this kind of thing properly  in fairness  jerry o connell  jordana brewster  jeremy sisto  julia stiles and charles s  dutton give their material the old college try  but they re wasted  especially the latter two   it s undeniably good to see david alan grier in a rare straight role as activist fred hampton  and rosanna arquette  in an uncredited cameo in part 2  is always welcome what isn t welcome is how  the  60s  drowns the soundtrack with so many period songs that it ultimately reduces its already minimal effect  and this may well be the only time an american tv presentation about post 60s america not_mentions the british invasion   not_beatles  not_rolling stones    then again  there s only so much tunes you can shoehorn into a soundtrack album  right    capping its surface skimming approach to both the time and the plot with an almost out of place happy ending   american dreams  and  the wonder years  did it all much  much better  nothing to see here you can t see elsewhere  people    except for julia stiles doing the twist  that is,0,1,0.3705645717653424

it is a real shame that nearly not_one under 30 knows the  over the top  writing of michael o donoghugh  magazine articles and snl skits that were genius for the time   and so it is a true shame that anyone who may take the opportunity to research his work will not_doubt take the easy way out and watch videos  thus leading them to mr mikes mondo video  this movie has clever elements that not_connect to the funny bone  the viewer experiences such things as cat diving swimming with the man who thinks he s found feline happiness by hurling these kittens into a pool which the camera follows in slow motion and montage sequence  then we are taken to an island to where all past fads are retired  hula hops  pet rocks  rainbow dread wigs etc   then we enter the music world  punk was a new variety of music at the time of this film  where  d  rate bar performer rootboy slim performs  boogie till you puke  in his own lazy style of dirt and eclectic sleaze  now the real beauty of all this is the back ground music  in many different styles with many different instruments the sound of telstar plays and replays  for those who don t understand telstar was the first american satellite launched into space and the theme was created to celebrate mans genius and triumph  mr mikes seems to have been meant as a signal of societal decay ridiculous wastes  now one thing the theater offered that the video release does not_was a live performance of sid vicious  ex sex pistol not_the wrestler  singing my way  his version is very different than sinatras as one might imagine but frankly i feel it is very much worth the listen   it s good  that is the sad part  in the vhs release paul anka refuses the rights of his song and the viewer is forced to experience 3 1 2 minutes of silence with an explanation rolling across the image of the singing dead sex pistol  i would give the theater release a 5 or 6 the video is closer to a 4 and now that so much is passé i can see where many people would give it a 3 or 2 5  if you want to see a good o donoghugh script watch scrooged   it is a better tribute to the mans insight and talent,0,1,0.725161391377095
the book is fantastic  this film is not_there is not_reason this film could not_have embraced a futuristic technological vision of the book  hell  total recall was released a few years later and that did a good job of it  even a clockwork orange released in the 70s did a good job of trying to make a futuristic world  the bleak german expressionistic colours  the black and white footage from the vision screens  there is not_reason for this approach for when the film was made in 1984  the main character is in a white collar writing job yet he dresses like he works with oil and grease in a garage  this film decides to take a mock communistic approach to set design  atmosphere and theme  yet the novel did not_dictate a communist  worship the humble worker theme itself  this book seriously needs to be adapted in a modern context as this book is more relevant today than ever before  i could not_watch more than 20 minutes of this crap  the soundtrack is annoying  the lack of foresight is annoying  this film seems to have been made to deny a sense of realism or believability when that is exactly what is required to hammer the novel s messages to the viewer,0,1,0.5377457444210169
one of a multitude of slashers that appeared in the early eighties  pranks is notable only for an early performance by daphne zuniga  the sure thing  the fly 2   her character dies fairly early on  and the rest of the film is totally forgettable during their christmas break  a group of students volunteer to clear a condemned college building of its furniture  a crazy killer  however  throws a spanner in the works by methodically bumping off the youngsters one by one in a variety of gruesome ways exploiting every stalk  n  slash cliché in the book  director jeffrey obrow delivers a tedious and unexciting horror that had me praying for the characters to be killed  so that i could get on with watching something more worthwhile  the majority of the deaths  which  let s face it  is why we generally watch this kind of film  are brief and not_that gory  the only truly grisly imagery comes right at the end when the bodies of the victims are discovered by the remaining survivor  there is one notably bloody dismembered corpse the film could ve done with more  at the last minute  the film saves itself from the disgrace of receiving the lowest possible score from me by having a nice unexpectedly downbeat ending  but this really is one for slasher completists only,0,1,0.37903065796677393
the real star of this ridiculous story is glorious technicolor  a visual treat to the eye  the film fails to stimulate the mind and heart  i was intrigued  at first  by the idea of dietrich and boyer leaving religion in order to  find  their capacity for love  what follows is a huge disappointment  boyer is the only real actor in the production and one feels his torment  dietrich s amazing wardrobe outshines her performance    at times her face is frightening to look at    a unfeeling mask  as a monk  boyer held the formula for the monastery s liquer  which reminds me of the true story of chartreuse     when he leaves his  marriage to god  the reaction by his fellow monks holds the shock and fear that perpetuate organized religion  the viewer feels boyer was well rid of his past  however  the journey that follows is all too predictable,0,1,0.659893077312519
this movie was god awful  from conception to execution  the us needs to set up a  star wars  site in this remote country  this is their premise  the way to gain access  the us concludes  is to win an obstacle course like cross country race  where the winner can ask anything of the leader  and who better to win this race known as the  game  than a gymnast  of course  a gymnast would be the perfect choice for this mission  and don t forget that his father was an operative  lucky for our hero  there happen to be gymnastic equipment in fortunate spots  like the stone pommel horse in the middle of a square  for not_reason  amidst crazy town  perfect but above and beyond the horrible  horibble premise  is the awkward fumblings of the romantic scenes  the obviously highly depressed ninjas whose only job seems to be holding a flag to point out the race path  and the worst climax ever  after winning the race  our hero puts forth the wishes of the us government  and lo and behold  all the effort was worth it  because the us gets its  star wars  site  huzzah  this is your triumphant ending   wow but still  being such a bad movie  it can be great fun to watch  the cover alone  depicting ninjas with machine guns  was enough to get me to rent this film but if i were ever to meet kurt thomas  the gymnast star  in real life  i would probably kick him in the face after a double somersault with 2 1 2 twists in the layout position,0,1,0.4738608792110451

it was 9 30 pm last night at my friend s camping trailer and we were so hyped to watch south park  a new episode   the thing is  in my country  south park airs at 10 30 pm and we decided to kill time by watching the show now airing  father of the pride  i ll start by saying that i have only watched to episodes  the first time i watched it  i found it unfunny and crude for nothing  so i thought   holy sh t  i have a football game early tomorrow  so i have to stop watching stupid cartoons    but yesterday  i tried to give father of the pride a second chance  i find that it s a complete rip off of the simpsons  only replacing yellow human characters by lions instead the second thing is i wonder why it got it s tv 14 rating  i find the simpsons a lot more vulgar  and the only real vulgarity in this show is a few homosexual  unfunny  jokes  the simpsons is also a lot more violent  halloween specials  and crude  i also heard that the creator of the series has also directed shrek 2  well i ve got news for him  shrek 2 was way better and i think he stayed too much in the family thematic  however  i must admit that father of the pride did make me smile  even burst out laughing once  three or four times all in all  i don t mind father of the pride  i don t hate it  but i don t like either  i ve seen way better from   the simpsons   3 5 10,0,1,0.48316784751967123
i rented this by mistake  i thought  after a cursory examination of the box  that this was a time travel sci fi story  instead  it s a  christian  story  and i suppose is fairly typical example  if you are sold on the message you probably will overlook the awkwardness of the plot acting etc   but i found it rather painful  i have to admit that i m bothered by the rewriting of history in this story  it paints the 1890 s as some sort of paradise of family values and morality  a character is aghast that 5  of marriages end in divorce    but it overlooks very unsavory sides of this  highly moral  society  rigid racial  sexual  and social discrimination were widespread  for instance   and at one point the hero complains to a clothing store owner about things that sound not_all that different than the complaints of some iranian leaders about women s clothing styles  as reported in a recent wsj  overall  thought  i suppose that it s the sort of thing you ll like if you like this sort of thing  and it s certainly wholesome,0,1,0.3862320704098473
there are moments in this unique cartoon of pure beauty but overall it s not_very good  limited animation as well as sub standard character and background design will limit its mass market appeal  the character design looks like a cross between the original star wars clone wars and disney s kim possible   brendan  the main character in this also bares an uncanny similarity to ron stoppable in kim possible  background design ranges as far and wide as going from being bland and depressing to stylish and stark  yet by today s standards  overall it is still poor and cheap looking  many of the backgrounds bare resemblances to eastern european or nordic animation from the mid 80 s  nice in its own way but for modern child audiences  used to cg slug fests and talking dogs with every piece of fur on their body swaying in the wind  is sure to disappoint  the story is also not_engaging and many of the voice actors aren t overly impressive  noticeably the usually brilliant brendan gleeson who appears to be phoning in his part  there are also a few secondary characters who come across as slightly cliché and stereotypically racist  however  some of the characters are good  the viking villains  although underused are well done and are specifically foreboding in both look and sound  there is one moment involving the main character and his mentor being saved by wolves from a viking attack that is very nicely put together  the look and feel also seemed to be very inspired by the film watership down including a blatant rip off homage to the ghost rabbit of inlay  the look is also clearly and obviously inspired by gaelic celtic anglo saxon art so if you are into these subjects you may be drawn towards its look  the film also does have moments of very nicely structured shots leading the eye in a very artistic manner  including a pretty match cut and a large scale viking attack that is very moody and impressive  best of all though is the music  much of the background music is melodic and moving  specifically the song by the spirit girl which is truly beautiful and haunting and works very well with the images it covers  if the whole film was as poetic as this moment   and it tries   then this would be a very beautiful and poetic film that would sadly still not_reach a wide audience  but instead it isn t a shame it wont reach a wider audience because most of it is average and cheap looking and doesn t stand up to modern animation standards  overall a film that clearly split my opinion in many ways  but all together not_great but worth watching for the music and song and the occasional pretty or scary moment  oh yeah and the cat seemed to live for a long time  not_sure how that was possible,0,1,0.5410160270674221

vodka lemon is a charming  yet extremely uneven arminian film that will delight some and bore others  though reasonably well crafted  the film lacks any real  zing   relying instead on many scenes that will seem commonplace to the astute art house viewer  the film contains a handful of moments of sheer cinematic brilliance  unfortunately  they deserve a film worthy of their genius  too dark to be a dark comedy and to light to be a serious drama  vodka lemon will leave many views disoriented and ultimately disgruntled  you may laugh  but these moments will be few and far between amid a sea of washed out snow filled landscapes and a seemingly endless series of bus rides  a noble effort  ultimately done in by lack of narrative cohesion,0,1,0.39439089948780104

it was 1974 and it starred martin sheen that alone says what to expect of this movie and it was a movie  according to the movie  slovik had reformed  got a good woman  and didn t want to fight in real life  slovik may have been a naive innocent  or he may have just wanted to manipulate the system whoever slovik was or wasn t is for history to decide  but this was a movie that dealt with dessertion at a time when a country was questioning why it was fighting  and the movie took sides with not_regard to servicemen who were in viet nam either in 1974  as willie nelson would say  let s tell the truth  it was about the viet nam war  not_wwii   eoes was as propagandistic as gung ho was in the forties according to this movie  slovik stated his position  plain and simple  he had a nervous problem  heck  i have a clinical nervous condition  and trust me  if i had done military duty  it would have been not_problem for me to either just let my nerves go and fail at my tasks and get a demotion or put on kp duty or latrine duty with not_problem if we believe the teleflick  slovik didn t have that option  not_doubt because of his criminal history whatever the viewer wants to believe is up to the viewer  i ve learned that movies from this decade or that decade  in dealing with service or military duty  will pretty much take the same stance over and over 1940s and 1950s  serve your country 1960s and 1970s  mock your country this is the history the whole movie seemed predictably hollywood to me  he refused to serve and only when he was being strapped up to be executed does he show emotion such an emotional outburst could have easily worked to his advantage in his declaration of his nervous condition  but obviously the movie wanted to show him as a human being and only when he is about to die does he become sorrowful i m not_a catholic  but i thought the recital of the hail mary by ned beatty and sheen at the end  with the lord s prayer  was funny as it sounded like they were trying to see who could say it faster i don t see how this movie could be watched without realizing it was aimed at tricky dick nixon and the viet nam war i hope it was all worth it for slovik and anyone who chose to follow his example,0,1,0.5058024839925018

if     is the cinematic equivalent of sgt  pepper s  revered by baby boomers as the pinnacle of creation  and viewed as rather a silly bit of business by preceding and subsequent generations  now that the children of the middle classes the world over are seemingly super human due to the internet  and view the prospect of boarding school as a wonderful opportunity thanks to the harry potter books films  the relevance of if     couldn t be further from modern concern  in fact  many scenes appear so alien and exaggerated as to hint at an inspiration for pink floyd s the wall one should not_hold personal bias against a film while reviewing  and the cemented date of this film aside  there are a few flaws which others have overlooked  lindsay anderson was known to be a fan of luis buñuel  on top of generally being too smart for his own good  and despite a straightforward narrative through the first and second acts  the latter portion of the piece it taken hostage by cod buñuel surrealism and strained attempts at symbolism  anderson wasn t capable of this feat due to his over intelligent cynicism  failing to see that buñuel was jovial in his work  i have not_found a critic whom champions the  chaplain in a drawer   and am almost certain it still gets sideways looks from those who adore this film  the ending is not_so much a concise punch to the established class values system  as a wet slap on a moving target the british public school system was firmly for the middle classes  the upper crust being educated at home by private tutors   and the modus operandi of if     was to check the boxes of public school life which lindsay believed had been unexplored in film  thereby savaging middle class pretense  homosexuality  generational cutlery  cold showers et al  in reality  such issues had been covered in many other great british films  if     merely brought them to the fore  the browning version was a more oblique damning of such pomp  to name but one if     is oddly quaint  and simply can not_be viewed with modern  especially american  eyes  kudos to anderson for avoiding mick and kieth in favour of african chant  and a few brownie points for the latent homoerotic overtones  points deducted for pretension  establishing characters who disappear  and inciting a glib revolution which came to naught,0,1,0.7809086800881285

this movie starts out promisingly  with an early scene in which frank morgan advises against gary cooper s marriage to his daughter  anita louise  frank morgan  playing an unabashed gold digger  loudly complains to cooper about his perceived penury at the hands of his family   including his daughter  anita louise  i am a fan of all 3 actors  frank morgan is  to my mind  a hollywood treasure  cooper a legend  and louise a very lovely  versatile and under appreciated actress seldom seen in the leading role  i also have nothing against teresa wright  and while not_blessed with great range  she usually delivers heart warming performances from a promising opening  the story slides downhill all the way to the end  i found nothing humorous about burning down the home of cooper s would be in laws  the butler in such a fastidious  non smoking household would not_just blithely walk away  allowing cooper to continue smoking  or alternatively he would certainly supply him with some means of disposing of his ill timed cigarette  moreover  nobody with any common sense would permit himself to be left holding a lit cigarette without asking for some means of disposing of it  and finally  nobody in his right mind crushes out a cigarette in a handkerchief and sticks it in his pocket  this whole sequence just made cooper seem foolish and gauche  it is a poor contrivance   ill conceived and filmed in a way that induces ridicule not_laughter  the forced medical examination of cooper is equally contrived  nobody lets himself undergo a complete medical examination without his being advised of its purpose or giving his consent  that cooper did so is too removed from reality to be funny   it s absurd  stealing babies from hospitals is a serious legal offense  and that  too  is nothing to laugh about  finally  the scenes of cooper s overly fastidious  neurotic attention to his baby s feeding and weight may have struck a nerve with a few people who have experienced anxiety over their own newborn babies  but to me they just seem tedious and slow  the wardrobe and prop departments went over the top in those scenes  while paradoxically  the script writer went to sleep the lines are just not_in the script to generate humor  they just miss on all cylinders  the laughs come not_a mile a minute  but more like a light year a minute  the only time the movie has any energy or humor is when frank morgan is on camera the scene that is totally wasted is when both of cooper s love interests and their respective fathers are cooped up in the same hotel room together  there is probably a rich vein of humor somewhere in that mine  but none of it was extracted in the end  one of the two very likable girls is going to get hurt  predictably  it is the anita louise character  who gets jilted on her would be wedding night  while it is not_on camera  that is her fate  and it is not_funny   even as a loose end  she hadn t done anything in this film to make me unsympathetic  unlike gail patrick  say  in my favorite wife   consequently  i was expecting  perhaps  hoping  is a better word in the context of the film   for anita louise to enjoy a happy ending  too  the fact that such a nice character is essentially wiped out at the movie s end really undermines the effect of the  happy ending  for cooper and wright i kept waiting for something to happen  for the witty dialog so characteristic of movies of the era    and it not_delivered  a good performance by frank morgan in a slightly different role is totally wasted here,0,1,0.4319885042906568

although i can see the potentially redeeming qualities in this film by way of it s intrigue  i most certainly thought that the painfully long nature in the way the scene structure played out was too much to ask of most viewers  enormous holes in the screenplay such as the not_explained  your father died today  comment by the mother made it even harder to try to make sense of these characters this won first place at cannes in 2001 which is a shock considering  perhaps the french had been starved for film noir that year and were desperate for something as sadistic as this film  i understood the long scenes as a device to keep the viewer as uncomfortable as possible but when matched with the inability to relate to the main character it went too far for me and kept me at arms distance from the story altogether this is a film for only the most dedicated fan of film noir and one who expects not_gratification from having watched a film once it s over  i loved movies such as  trainspotting  or  requiem for a dream    which were far more disturbing but at least gave the viewer something in the way of editing and pacing  to watch this teachers slow and painful silence scene after scene just became so redundant that i found it tedious   and i really wanted to like this film at every turn,0,1,0.4821426679846396
