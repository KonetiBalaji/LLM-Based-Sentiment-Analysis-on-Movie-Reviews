okay  first of all i got this movie as a christmas present so it was free  first   this movie was meant to be in stereoscopic 3d  it is for the most part  but whenever the main character is in her car the movie falls flat to 2d  what       it s not_that hard to film in a car    second   the story isn t very good  there are a lot of things wrong with it third   why are they showing all of the deaths in the beginning of the film  it made the movie suck whenever some was going to get killed    watch it for a good laugh   but don t waste your time buying it  just download it or something for cheap,1,0,0.05386577083602896
honestly  i was expecting to hate this one  and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it   but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed  a group of college kids and their teacher go on a  field trip  to ireland  their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace  the group of post teens is warned by the property s caretaker not_to venture into the woods   but being the stupid b movie characters that they are   of course they pay not_attention and pay for their mistake one by one    first off  there is plenty wrong with evil breed  the acting dialog is pretty weak  and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson  chasey lain  ginger lynn  and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here   and jenna s role in this production is grossly over hyped  as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time  even less with chasey  and ginger lynn shows not_skin and has the worst irish accent ever  also the last scene of the film makes absolutely not_sense and feels like it s thrown in just to end the film  those gripes aside   there is some good stuff as well  richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on  with greico s nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey s guts hanging out from being torn in half  though how she ends up this way isn t shown on screen    not_bad for the first 5 minutes  the other kill scenes are pretty inventive  including jenna s forced breast implant removal  a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass  a knife through the face  and a few other notables  the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it s a shame the producers made them chop  em  so to speak  also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don t really have too much time to be bored  the  creature  fx are also done competently which definitely helps  overall  evil breed was not_as bad as i expected  this one  along with satan s little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low budget straight to video films  i usually steer clear of them as a whole  but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith  evil breed is not_masterpiece  but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes   might not_hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you re at it   i know i was  and i m sure it didn t hurt the experience  7 5 10,1,0,0.056386115424525665
wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince  simon  who is banished from his kingdom due to his father  the king  being killed by the cliche  evil adviser   this movie s about simon s adventures  the special effects  plot  acting  and generally everything about this movie is bad  however  it s so bad that it s funny  you will keep watching this movie simply because it s so bad it s funny  and  like the other reviewer of the movie said  it s so bad it s good,1,0,0.06568222414440443
hardly a masterpiece  not_so well written  beautiful cinematography i think not_this movie wasn t too terrible but it wasn t that much better than average  the main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was    should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically  because mom says we can t   some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters  couple times i was wondering if the writer director was a fan of george lucas  classic american graffiti  not_that it s wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that  i mean come on  worst part of this was that madchen amick had such a small part  i mean double come on   she was the only one  in one or two lines  who actually tried a southern accent   take a good listen  it was there even though her character was from california  doh    maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie  oh well  what can ya do when you have a director who s just a director and not_an artist  also  too bad  overall i give this a b  and that s being a little generous  cause i m partial to ms  amick,1,0,0.06868981039367945
i m gonna tip the scales here a bit and say i enjoyed this  however  the cartoon is really only going to appeal to those who have very absurdist tendencies  it s definitely something that most people will not_get  as is the nature of absurdism the animation is horrible  but yes  that s the point  the main character is foul mouthed  violent  and stupid  not_redeeming qualities whatsoever  his wife shrieks and wails  apparently just barely capable of the most basic communication skills  most of these stories completely lack any kind of point but again  that s the point   if non sequiters  foul language  and complete and utter randomness are your thing  you re going to love this it is really short  so i would probably rent instead of buying,1,0,0.0713913177094714

was this based on a comic book  a video game  a drawing by a 3 year old  there is nothing in this movie to be taken seriously at all  not_the characters  not_the dialog  not_the plot  not_the action  nothing  we have high tech international terrorists criminals who bicker like pre school kids  stallone s man of steel type resilience towards ice cold weather  dialog so dumb that it s sometimes almost hilarious  and so on  even the codename that the bad guys use is dumb   tango tango    a film that entertains through some suspense  good action sequences  and a nice snowy mountainous setting  oh  yes  and the unintentional humour the film opens with some truly bad and unconvincing gay banter between our go lucky and happy characters who are obviously having a  swell  time  then comes a sweat inducing failed rescue part  which should make anyone with fear of heights problems want to pull their hair out  and then we have some more bad dialog  and after that some more great action  this is the rhythm of the film in a nutshell  stallone s melodramatic exchange with turner  when they meet after a long time  is so soapy  so clichéd  so fake  and so bad that it should force a chuckle out of any self respecting viewer  soon after this display of awful dialog writing  we are witnesses to a spectacular and excellently shot hijack of an airplane  the entire action is one big absurdity  but it s mindless fun at its best  although the rest of the action is exciting and fun  the airplane scenes are truly the highlight of the film  after the landing  our master criminals seek for a guide and end up with stallone and rooker  they send stallone to fetch the first case of money  but somehow they do everything to make it as difficult as possible for him to reach it  they take most of his clothes off  so he can freeze  and they won t give him the equipment he needs  so he can fall off   do these gangsters want their money fetched or not_very silly  apparently they don t trust stallone  but surely they know that they can always black mail him by using rooker as a hostage  nevertheless  our gangsters make stallone s climb difficult  if for not_logical reasons then to at least show us how truly evil they are   lest there be any doubts  and for those who might still doubt how evil the bad guys are  they overact  brag  and snicker in a truly evil manner  everyone convinced  good  you d better be  otherwise the writers will throw in a mass execution of twenty school children  just to make sure that the evilness of the bad guys is crystal clear to everyone the old guy who flies the chopper    how the hell did he fall for the trap  firstly  he must have been warned by the mtv airhead about the criminals  and secondly  he must have heard stallone s and rooker s voices on the walkie talkies  a whole bunch of idiotic verbal exchanges take place  with lithgow having the questionable honour of getting most of the silly lines   get off my back   lithgow   i haven t even started climbing on your back   or  lithgow to stallone   we had a deal  but now we only have each other   and as for lithgow s gang of murderers  these guys not_seem to want to kill immediately  they are very creative about it  they philosophize  pretend that they are playing football with your body  and so on  stallone co wrote this thing  i have not_idea what drugs he was on when he did it  i d hate to think the script is this bad because of a low i q,1,0,0.08339051793647496

why does this have such a low rating  i really don t get it    is it because of the bad acting  the bad dialogue  well  who cares about these things in cheesy low budget horror movies  seriously  the acting and the dialogue isn t important in those movies  people who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldn t be allowed to rate cheesy low budget movies  those movies shouldn t be taken seriously  period anyway  time to talk about the movie  right  well  i loved it  i bought it because i expected a gorefest  but it s not_a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad  most of the time it s just animal guts placed on the body of the actors and that s lame   but i didn t really care because the movie is hilarious  the characters are hilarious  the acting is hilarious  bad acting is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies   the dialogue is hilarious  bad dialogue is a good thing in cheesy low budget horror movies   the zombie rapist with a huge dick is hilarious  the flying demon baby is hilarious and i could go on and on and on  but i don t want to say too much    but i have to mention that there s a scene in which a girl masturbates a sex doll like it s alive lol  oh and the zombie rapist falls in love with the sex doll lol best lines in the movie detective manners   sniffs coke  detective sloane  what the  beep  are you doing  manners  what the hell did you snort  what the hell is that  detective manners  it s nothing man  it s    ehh    cold medicine   detective manners   injects heroin in his arm  detective sloane  what the  beep  are you doing  manners  are you  beep  insane  detective manners  it s cold medicine detective manners   repeatedly kicks a random guy in the face  detective sloane  what the hell s going on  manners  what are you doing  detective manners  this maniac was rambling about demons and then he started smashing his head on the rock  he just started smashing his head on the rock  i think he s on pcp or something lol,1,0,0.09028187471903261
the movie wasn t all that great  the book is better  but the movie wasn t all that bad either  it was interesting to say the least  the plot had enough suspense to keep me watching although i wouldn t say i was actually interested in the movie itself  janine turner and antonio sabato jr are both gorgeous enough to keep you watching   they have a few cute scene s that should appeal to the romantic s  overall i d give the movie a 7 or 8  it wasn t bad  just a little lacking plot wise,1,0,0.09991738161350834
let s get some things straight first  zombies don t exist so the filmmaker can have them walk  run  hell even fly if he wants to  that s what makes this original zombie movie so good  everything they did was so damn original  i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero  some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical romero movie  once again zombies don t exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants  the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not_decaying corpses since they just freaking died  they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood  one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat  it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it  this movie got really good reviews in fangoria and rue morgue so that made me want to go see it  i m glad i listened  they are always right when it comes to real horror fan s tastes  10 out of 10  go rent it,1,0,0.10954811663583626
sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands  wayne s world  the first one  not_the second   but most often they have duds  it s pat comes to mind rather quickly   this time out it s tim meadows as the ladies man  this movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud  it was very funny for the first 20 minutes  but then  as usually happens with snl skits  it starts to slow down  before finally ending  long after it should have tim meadows is leon phelps  a radio dj with a nightly show called the ladies man  he answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships  usually in the crudest way possible  everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt  after pushing the buttons of the station manager  leon  along with his producer julie  karyn parsons  gets fired  and needs to find another job  out of the random blue  comes a letter from one of his ex ladies  the letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life  the only problem being that the letter isn t signed  so leon needs to track down all the women he s been with to find the woman of his dreams  but sometimes  as billy dee williams says in the film  the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you  there is also a sub plot about a bunch of guys who s wives girlfriends have all slept with leon  and they want to first figure out who he is  by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy   then kill him  leading this bunch of guys is  surprise  will ferrell from snl  first off  i thought the sub plot was rather lame  the singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless  i usually like will ferrell but here he just not_clicked for me  and the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along  and in the end all decided that having their wives girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault  so back to the main story  the story basically centers around leon and sex  so what it comes down to is  if you don t like the character of leon  you won t like the movie  his voice  his mannerisms  his dialogue is what carries the movie  i am not_a big fan of tim meadows  i not_thought he was a particularly good actor on snl  the only thing i ever really liked of his  was his ladies man skits  but the best thing about those  is that they usually involved the guest host  remember the one with cameron diaz    and they were short  for about 5 minutes  they were pretty funny  and here  for about 20 minutes  it s really funny  what i thought was good about the character in the movie  is that he stayed in character throughout  he not_wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona  until right at the end where there was this transformation  and the ever present speech to tie things up  other than that  it was pretty good at keeping leon as leon  and not_changing him into something less crude than he was  there isn t a lot of substance to this movie  if you couldn t guess  but like i said earlier  the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny  some real laugh out loud moments  all revolving around sex and his crudeness  the problem of course with this movie  and most other snl spin offs  is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time  stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult  that difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub plot  because without it  this movie would have been a little under an hour  when it was good  it was good  but when it wasn t good  it got to be boring so overall  the ladies man wasn t as bad as other snl films  but it wasn t as good as others  it had some funny moments  the first 20 minutes was pretty good  but the rest of it dragged on  there was an unnecessary sub plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film  the bottom line is  if you like tim meadows and his leon phelps character  you ll be able to watch the film  if he annoys you  don t even bother going  unless you just want to see tiffani theissen in some nice revealing clothing,1,0,0.11451359013626233
this film evil breed  the legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort  it is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast  slasher  style death and plain disgusting acts of death  the acting was rated a d as the actors show very little ability  and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable  the way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different  the odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesn t offer much  and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death  example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus  and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes  it is terribly obvious of how little of a fight the kids put up  this film is a good choice for someone who likes to watch some awful deaths and practically torture,1,0,0.12121535716939744
well  well    roeg touched a bit of a nerve there  didn t he  he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters  descents into psychosis for a couple of decades  but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption  or even some good advice  might be found in the bad old catholic church  the hipper than thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious  worse still  theresa russell s character   faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for  is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level   that of the spiritual  you know  the realm of the ignorant and superstitious  the sort of thing that the art house cinephiles are supposed to be above  oh  the horror    so she finds her marriage   the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment   affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention  people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives  but they probably won t  sure  this film has some problems  notably talia shire s delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun  1950s style attire and all  and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations  though hitchcock s movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst   but  sadly  nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents,1,0,0.12307775992893522
but the opposite  sorry bud  i completely understand how you can be dragged into a film because you relate to the subject   and you have   this film is terrible  the main character would give any charlie brown subtitler a run for his money he just constantly mumbles which is always a laugh  most scenes just feel awkward with characters more often than not_gazing across to another with a look of   its your line now  then i will react  best british comedy  please buddy  have a strong word with your bad bad self   at the end of the day    the sun goes down   and this film is awful  i mean well done to the people involved   they have made a film   and maybe motorbike enthusiasts may be into it but people that still live here on earth with an actual sense of humour will struggle with this more than smiling at the christmas present they re nan bought them   was that overly harsh  i do apologise,1,0,0.12658285337121883
what do you do with a 14 inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder  and then died of aids  you make a movie  of course  the probable reason why it wasn t made earlier is the fact that eddie nash would have been in the way of its production  so it s not_coincidence that the film was made just a little while after nash was sent to prison the best thing about the movie is its quick pace  there is not_time wasted on unnecessary crap  and why would it be  there is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes the cast is good  kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies  so here was finally a role quite suitable for him  bosworth is cute so it s irrelevant how she acts  she s solid   and mcdermott  who is otherwise quite annoying  is rather good  to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that i didn t recognize him at first   i wish they did that to cruise in every movie so i wouldn t have to watch his dumb face   i utterly failed to recognize christina applegate  and wouldn t have known she was in it  had i not_seen her name in the end credits  kudrow is charming as ever  a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role   btw   friends  is the worst tv sitcom of all time   the only casting choices that were questionable were an early near cameo by carrie fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron janeane garofalo  you thought i d include paris hilton  too  didn t you  not_i think hilton is the ideal choice in her 10 second appearance as a dumb whore  because the film is about decadence  among other things   and about a porn actor   she fits in perfectly,1,0,0.12888075909776267

i really wanted to like this film and i don t think i was terribly disappointed  being an american history teacher  i felt an obligation  almost  to see this film and as far as the history went  it wasn t bad  sure there were a few mistakes here and there  especially with the timeline  the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year  not_over six years of actual fighting   but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent  unfortunately  the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist  for the most part  it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed  tacked on   like a plot device instead of a real honest to goodness romance  in fact  as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb cliché of  love at fist sight   it was kind of annoying the more i think about it however  in spite of this romance  the film is truly interesting and inspiring   plus  in so many ways it seems as if the much later film  the patriot  was copied from this griffith film    both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians  and both having the secret intention of using this as a  springboard  to starting their own nation in the america    the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas  it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d  w  griffith for the story ideas  it just doesn t seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other ps  despite me liking this film and some other of griffith s films  he does deserve to once again  burn in hell  for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film  this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his films  especially in birth of a nation  i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was a ok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this  quaint institution   don t get mad at me  this is meant as sarcasm,1,0,0.1300461635892202
time for a rant  eh  i thought spirit was a great movie to watch  however  there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7  i m being a little bit generous with the 7  point  1  matt damon aggravates me  i was thinking   what a dicky voice they got for the main character   when i first heard him narrate   and then i realized it is matt damon  the man bugs me so very bad   his performance in  the departed  was terrible and ruined the movie for me  before the movie got a chance to ruin itself  but that s another story for some other time   as it almost did  spirit   i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was    thankfully point  2  brian adams sucks    the whole score was terrible    the songs were unoriginal  generic  and poorly executed  not_once did i find the music to fit  and the lyrics were terrible  every time one of the lame songs came on  i was turned off  i almost thought i d start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super american freedom style lyrics  i couldn t help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9 11   in light of the native american aspects of the film  they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments  not_petty radio hit  teen bop  14 year old girl crap  i thought i was back in junior high school  i can t believe not_better could have been done  i refuse to  had it not_have been for this  i d rank the film up more with disney  which knows a thing or two about originality  ok  don t bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking     too bad  it s a shame they couldn t have hired better musicians i liked the art and animation  except for some things here and there    like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body  thick dark lines mainly near the end   there were often times when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion  but there were also times when the emotion ran thick  anyhow  many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent ok  i m falling asleep here so i ll sum it up before i start making less sense   nice try on an epic film    it turned out mediocre though  matt damon  you suck,1,0,0.13201678569782896
