the 1930  were a golden age of los angeles with its film industry and great potential of various other possibilities to become rich and famous and happy  people were arriving there hoping to fulfill their dreams  expecting open arms and welcoming offers there were only a few who managed to succeed and find their way to stardom  majority then condemned to live starving  disillusioned and unwanted  searching for a bit of respect in dirty bars and nasty hotel rooms  young italian american writer arturo bandini arrives to la on a similar quest   to spread his charms around to get one of those beautiful wealthy women and to write an excellent novel that would set him on a career path  having so far written a single short story published in an obscure anthology  wishing to create a romantic masterpiece he seems to be unable to produce anything without experiencing it himself though  occasionally  he sends pieces of magazine stories to a local editor that helps him survive  he is proud to present himself as an italian but deep in his heart he truly feels his italian origin as a burden  the little money and the courage to conquer the world he once had are all long gone and watching his dream turning into a hangover he holds a last single nickel to spend  the coffee she brought him was cold and sour and spitting a curse on her triggers a not_ending relationship of insults  unspoken excuses and a love concealed beneath  camilla being an uneducated girl trying to receive us citizenship through a marriage also carries her heavy cross of a non perspective racial heritage  though she is much of a stronger and life experienced person her situation as a beautiful mexican woman is much harder to deal with than arturo is able to realize  is it obvious that arturo eventually finds his inspiration to work on the novel  is it possible that their love finally finds its place in the sun  is it likely that their romance takes an unlucky turn it is very surprising to find out that the chemistry between the two main characters  performed by salma hayek and colin farrell  does not_work  the relationship lacks the raw and authentic feelings  hayek though livelier a character compared to farrell s forgot to arm camilla with the passion and strength of her once brilliant character frida  also it is hard to have faith in a character which being intelligent but uneducated and illiterate uses quite difficult vocabulary and complicated sentences  a tougher character of a phil marlowe sort would definitely suit farrell better  though he looks stunning in a period costume  he seems very lost trying to find the fragile world of a twenty year old dreamer balancing between a hidden love and desire to be true to himself  feeling embarrassed watching the two on the screen is not_right  their relationship might have been wild but it is more likely what a thunder and a lightning are without a storm  far from real passion  feelings just described not_felt inside  it is very sad that such a potential of an interesting script and good actors was wasted  turned into a grey average of soon to be forgotten,0,1,0.8933598582461468
i m a jean harlow fan  because she had star quality  i don t think her movies are good and i don t even think that she was a good actress  but she certainly was great in comedies  every bit of comedy in the girl from missouri is very good  but this movie is perhaps more like a love story  jean harlow is wonderful in this one and you can forget the rest of the cast   their performances bring nothing new  it always impresses me much to think that harlow s beautiful body was that of an ill woman  well  in this movie she does look beautiful,0,1,0.8900744750935994
in the days before gore and sex took over  real horror films were made  castle of blood is  in my estimation  one of the finest  although other reviewers have given it mixed ratings  in an odd sort of way it reminds of the more recent the others  which was in the theaters a couple of years ago director antonio margheriti remade his own picture in 1970 titling it this time web of the spider  aka nella stretta morsa del ragno   why he did this i do not_understand  although the remake starred anthony franciosa and klaus kinski and was very good in its own right  perhaps he saw a good story and wished to tailor it more to american audiences  i do not_know  it is interesting that he did the original in black and white and the remake in color castle of blood is excellent italian gothic  la danza macabra is said to be an unpublished work of edgar allen poe  who  appears  in this film  poe and lord blackwood  owner of a haunted castle  bet american writer alan foster  george riviere  that he cannot spend all souls night in said castle and survive  foster eagerly accepts the bet but soon regrets it  for he is witness to a series of murders committed by ghosts  it seems that the ghosts come back to life once every few years but are doomed to re enact the crimes they committed in life  lord blackwood conveniently forgot to tell foster that his blood is needed for them to resurrect themselves on the next all souls night  it does not_take foster and the beautiful elisabeth blackwood  portrayed by the incomparable barbara steele  long to fall in love  even though their romance is doomed  because elisabeth is one of the ghosts  i will not_give the ending away  but will just say that castle of blood is every bit a romantic tragedy as it is a horror story  comments  this film is greatly atmospheric  even by the excellent standards of the italians  my personal opinion is they do true horror better than anybody  and the somewhat dim black and white filming only enhances this  in fairness  web of the spider was fine in its own right  even with color and greater brightness  i loved the lingering shots  something most modern day directors do not_have the patience for  indeed  when alan first enters the doomed castle  we are treated to several minutes of him doing nothing but roaming around from room to room  the dread ands unease building in his face and mannerisms  by the time the first ghost appears  the audience is thoroughly primed and ready  there is wonderful dialogue between alan and the ghosts  something else not_often done in standard ghost stories  there are also memorable scenes  very visual for this type of film  elisabeth s  murder  and the dance scene  reminds somewhat of the similar dance of the ghouls in 1962 s carnival of souls  were particularly good sadly  few general interest viewers will ever hear of  much less see  this film  that is a shame  for this one is a cut above the rest  i got my copy from sinister cinema and am not_certain if it can be purchased anywhere else  for persons interested in this genre  it is a must see,0,1,0.8804726855000504
welcome to our town  welcome to your town  as we are introduced into the worlds of its townsfolk of 1901 america  this three act play is opened before us with the help of  the stage manager   a visual narrator if you like  after his initial introductions  we are lead into the homes of two particular families  the webb s and the gibb s this is most definitely middle america at the turn of the century  and the progressive way of life of the american dream and its saccharine overtones that can seem a little biased in this dream town  here we see the everyday lives of some of its 2642 populace of grover s corners  new hampshire  even if there are  too  the migrant polish workers that add another 500 to is numbers  they  not_get a look in once the daily lives of these families have been introduced  wives cooking  children home working  fathers working  kids falling in love and the clean picket fences painted white  the second act is started three years later  after young george  a young and unrecognisable william holden  then aged 22  and emily have fallen in love and intend to marry  blossoming lovebirds reaching for the stars and reaching  too  a turning point in their own lives  from the nest they lived and now  into the anxieties and woes of young adulthood they nervously step  the third act is slightly more sour and foreboding  it is in this act that the movies intentions become apparent  here we see not_life  not_celebration but death  and it is in this predicament that the dead  as they return to revisit and reconcile their own life past  are here to remind us  to tell us  that life  and every last minute  every precious breath is not_to be wasted and squandered it is in this last third that the movies own political stance also seems more apparent too  feeling more of a propaganda stunt on the moral lecturing on  and by  middle america and how it should direct its home and how it should also put it in order  this isn t just about  our  town  this is moral diction aimed at  our  souls and how america can better itself if its peoples    excluding the poles  the irish  the native american and the freed ethnic minorities   and minorities  in general  plus the supporting backbone of the americana s who  still  have not_had a fair part in this narrative   such as the middle classes  can live up to the expectations of the american dream through honest  decent living  the purveyors of the american dream with special invitation only i was entertained  slightly  by this movie too  but i felt that its narrative held a stronger impact than anything else that took part in it albeit the bland acting  the musical score or how well  or not_it was made  this was the movies intention to exclude other groups  and to only include the likes of the webb s and the gibb s  in the future of the developing country of the usa  a good movie  but also a slightly biased in its stance  i thought taken from the play by us  born thornton wilder  1897   1975  this pulitzer prize winning play  and six academy award nominated movie  was the focal point on the perpetual motion of life and its three main attributes  life  love and death  the plays translation onto celluloid comes across as a slightly to the right blurb of social consciousness  our town starts off with what seems a lesson in pointlessness  like other towns  nothing too exciting ever happens here  if anything at all  this town only has the  right sort of people   you can still leave your back door unlocked here  we are seeing the developing lives of these two families  but it is their moral and social stance that is more important than them themselves  our town may just have been  any town   just as long as you came from the right part of town that is,0,1,0.8683716898048556

jack london s life was certainly colorful enough for a dozen films about different aspects of him  sad to say though that what his life was used for in film was some wartime propaganda that put the best face on some of the least attractive parts of his character jack london who barely saw the age of 40 when he died wrote some of the best stories around  he wrote on what he knew  but he also wrote as does everyone else bringing the baggage of his own life experience with him  some of that experience in another day and time would have been condemned as racism  but this was world war ii and london was a big believer in the  yellow peril  as it was called back in the day two thirds of the film covers his life as author  we see his years as a seaman from where he got the inspiration for the sea wolf  we see him up in the yukon in a miner s cabin with a dog that was not_doubt his inspiration for the call of the wild  london was able to capture the spirit of adventure that his own life was all about right on paper for the world to enjoy ever since the final third dealt with his time as a war correspondent covering the russo japanese war  london was a socialist  but his socialism did not_encompass folks who were oriental  like a few million others he saw the rising immigration of the chinese and japanese to our pacific coast as a threat to jobs for the white people  he advocated strict immigration policies for orientals the film puts the cart before the horse  london is presented as a man who saw because he was on hand at the russo japanese war what japan s ambitions were and for that reason was as xenophobic as he was  actually the kind of atrocities present in world war ii were not_existent during the russo japanese conflict  japan had her imperial ambitions  but so did everyone else including the usa at that time  but our immigration policies caused by pressure from our west coast politicians was a big contributing factor to the deterioration of relations with japan over a couple of generations  london was part of the cause not_a prophet crying in the wilderness this film was the first independent production of samuel bronston who later did some films with a bit more budget than jack london  had he a bit more money bronston might have gotten james cagney or spencer tracy  both who would have been right for the role  instead they got michael o shea who was making his second film after lady of burlesque  o shea is fine in the part  but certainly was not_box office as london is covering the war  he meets up with a captain tanaka who is played by leonard strong  an actor who specialized in orientals and played a ton of them in world war ii  from the vantage point in 1905 strong outlines in the best fu manchu tradition japan s imperial aims right up to taking on the usa eventually  must have gone over great with the swing shift crowd  a lot of course is left out of london s life including a first wife  playing the second and only wife in this film is susan hayward who only comes into the movie when it s half over  i wish we d have seen more of her  charmian kittredge london survived her husband by almost 40 years dying in 1955 o shea in fact met and married the leading lady of his life in jack london  virginia mayo has a small role in jack london and they married for 30 years until o shea died in 1973 maybe one day we ll get a view of jack london that will be a lot better than this one,0,1,0.8585557146486171

a charming boy and his mother move to a middle of nowhere town  cats and death soon follow them  that about sums it up i ll admit that i am a little freaked out by cats after seeing this movie  but in all seriousness in spite of the numerous things that are wrong with this film  and believe me there is plenty of that to go around  it is overall a very enjoyable viewing experience the characters are more like caricatures here with only their basis instincts to rely on  fear  greed  pride lust or anger seems to be all that motivate these people  although it can be argued that that seeming failing  in actuality  serves the telling of the story  the supernatural premise and the fact that it is a stephen king screenplay not_that i have anything specific against mr  king  are quite nicely supported by some interesting fx work  makeup and quite suitable music  the absolute gem of this film is without a doubt alice krige who plays mary brady  the otherworldly mother king manages to take a simple story of outsider  or people who are a little different okay   a lot in this case   trying to fit in and twists it into a campy over the top little horror gem that has to be in the collection of any horror fan,0,1,0.8527223890640813

within the realm of science fiction  two particular themes consistently elicit interest  were initially explored in the literature of a pre cinematic era  and have since been periodically revisited by filmmakers and writers alike  with varying degrees of success  the first theme  that of time travel  has held an unwavering fascination for fans of film  as well as the written word  most recently on the screen with yet another version of the h g  wells classic   the time machine   the second theme  which also manages to hold audiences in thrall  is that of invisibility  which sparks the imagination with it s seemingly endless and myriad possibilities  and this theme  too  has again become the basis for a film adapted from another h g  wells classic   the invisible man   the realization of which  here  is  hollow man   directed by paul verhoeven  and starring kevin bacon and elisabeth shue sebastian caine  bacon  and his colleagues have for some time been conducting experiments for the u s  government  exploring the possibility and practicality of invisibility  which they have  at last  achieved in a number of the primates upon which they have tested their method  they have  in fact  progressed to the point that effecting the invisibility is assured  their only problem now is bringing the subject back to the original  visual  state of being  it s a problem  however  that caine  after diligent effort and too many hours in the lab  has solved   or so he thinks  and when the application of his theory on a live subject is successful  he decides to present the results to the board of directors  in an effort to thereby maintain the funding necessary for the continuation of the project at the last minute  though  caine demurs  fearing that control of the project will be wrested from him before they can proceed to the next level   the testing of a human subject  and he takes it upon himself to become that subject  securing the assistance of his research team by telling them that they ve been given approval by the board to do so  but something goes wrong  and caine becomes trapped in his cloak of invisibility  and as he and his team struggle to find the solution to his considerable dilemma before it s too late  it all begins to take a toll on caine s mind  and suddenly  his fear of losing funding and control becomes inconsequential  as he finds himself facing the imminent danger of losing much more than that  now there s a very real chance that he may lose everything   including himself verhoeven has crafted what is initially an exciting  even thought provoking film  he establishes a good pace and uses the f x at his disposal to great effect  though he does tend to allow the striking visuals to overwhelm the character development  anyone familiar with  the invisible man   or actually anyone who can logically follow the progression of the story  will know early on that caine is not_destined for happier times  still  verhoeven has a style of storytelling that is definitely going to capture the attention and engage his audience  but he seems bent on rushing toward the climax  and along the way he abandons any and all of the nuance that has made his film thus far successful  opting to enter into a final sequence that is nothing more than a mindless blood and gore fest that betrays his audience and everything he s worked for earlier in the film  rather than seeking an intelligent resolution to caine s suffering  and using some inventiveness and imagination to take the film to it s inevitable conclusion  verhoeven takes the low road  and though it may succeed on a purely visceral level  any meaning one could derive from the story dissolves like so many ashes in the wind  along with anything that would have made this a memorable film  and it s a shame  because verhoeven has it at a higher level than much of what is offered in this genre  and he allows it to sink unnecessarily to one much lower kevin bacon does a good job of creating a character that is believable  if only on the surface  which seemingly serves verhoeven s purposes perfectly  there s little depth to bacon s portrayal  but it has more to do with his director s agenda than his own acting abilities  verhoeven simply does not_allow bacon the time to develop caine to any extent  the character is mainly a vessel around which verhoeven can build his story  and toward that end  it works  the film would have been better served  however  had verhoeven and bacon collaborated more closely on at least developing a bond between caine and the audience that would have prompted some emotional involvement on the viewers part  something that would have drawn them in a bit  rather than leaving them at the gate  as it were  as mere observers of an f x laden extravaganza elisabeth shue comports herself well in the role of linda mckay  caine s willing accomplice in the ill fated experiment  but it s basically a thankless part that offers little challenge  especially to an actor of shue s caliber  the same can be said of kim dickens  so magnificent in the 2001 film   things behind the sun    her character  sarah kennedy  does little more than support the action and f x  both actors are capable of so much more  and deserve better than what they are given to work with here the supporting cast includes josh brolin  matthew   greg grunberg  carter   joey slotnick  frank   mary randle  janice  and william devane  dr  kramer   entertaining to a point  and even successful on a certain  low  level   hollow man  is one of those films that leaves you contemplating what could have been  like an annual fireworks display  it will give you some momentary thrills  but after awhile it ll begin to blend in with all the others you ve seen  without anything special to set it apart  and it s too bad  because given the talent and abilities of those involved here  it could have been so much more  i rate this one 4
