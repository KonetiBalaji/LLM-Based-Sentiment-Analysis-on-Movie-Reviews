i just can t believe some of the comments on this show  the show is just genius  sure it doesn t follow the tried and true  but do we as consumers always want the same things thrust at us over and over again  shouldn t we have the option to sit back and enjoy something new once in a while  the style is not_as realistic as previous  scooby doo  shows  but it s not_supposed to be  the show it titled  shaggy and scooby doo get a clue  what part of that title states that the entire beloved cast of other renditions would constantly join in the action  and nowhere does it say that they d be solving mysteries  and they can t even stand monsters  so why would they  i m actually glad that they put some long standing plot points that work into a scooby doo show  they still have running jokes  clumsy hi jinks  quick change outfits in chase scenes  the standard hallway gag and even scooby snacks  in fact i m glad that this show is out there  because i just love it  i m even glad they got rid of the rest of the team for a while and concentrated on just two main characters and a villain sure it s ridiculous  it s supposed to be  sure it s different  it s supposed to be  it s supposed to make you laugh at the villain  and cheer for the idiotic robotic butler to triumph over all intruding vermin  not_matter what the size  you re supposed to get the running  roobi roo  joke  the whole thing is just put together so well  there isn t a single thing i can think that is wrong with it  the writing  the acting  the animation  all top notch  the title music is awesome  my computer plays  get a clue   when it boots up   and the background music is just gripping,1,0,0.14449353154748196
i really wanted to like this film and i don t think i was terribly disappointed  being an american history teacher  i felt an obligation  almost  to see this film and as far as the history went  it wasn t bad  sure there were a few mistakes here and there  especially with the timeline  the movie only appeared to last a few months or perhaps a year  not_over six years of actual fighting   but the overall spirit of the film and the battle sequences were excellent  unfortunately  the movie also included a pretty meaningless subplot involving a difficult to believe romance between a poor patriot and a rich loyalist  for the most part  it really served to distract from the overall plot and just seemed  tacked on   like a plot device instead of a real honest to goodness romance  in fact  as much of the romance boiled down to the dumb clich√© of  love at fist sight   it was kind of annoying the more i think about it however  in spite of this romance  the film is truly interesting and inspiring   plus  in so many ways it seems as if the much later film  the patriot  was copied from this griffith film    both films followed the exploits of an evil leader fighting for the british and using horrible and evil tactics against the civilians  and both having the secret intention of using this as a  springboard  to starting their own nation in the america    the only major difference is that this film is set in the north and the patriot was in the carolinas  it sure would have been nice if mel gibson and the rest had acknowledged their debt to d  w  griffith for the story ideas  it just doesn t seem all that likely that the two stories were created independently of each other ps  despite me liking this film and some other of griffith s films  he does deserve to once again  burn in hell  for his having white actors portray all the black servants in the film  this is a sick and bigoted thing that griffith did in so many of his films  especially in birth of a nation  i gotta assume based on this and the way he portrays blacks that he was a ok with slavery and was quite the apologist for this  quaint institution   don t get mad at me  this is meant as sarcasm,1,0,0.1300461635892202
yes  the plot is hardly plausible and very thin  yes  the acting does range from average to laughable  yes  it has been done so many times before  however what we are dealing with is a film that does not_shy away from these facts and pretends to be nothing more than it is  there are indeed some original death scenes and the tension does increase throughout the movie  in addition you are not_more than a few minutes away from a gory killing  i urge everyone to watch this film with an unprejudiced eye and see it for what it set out to be  a scary  funny slasher flick with a theme tune second to none,1,0,0.21176150328549445

a meteor drops from the sky and reawakens a plesiosaur that long ago used to terrorize the area around crater lake   as the monster eats the locals they try and find away of killing the monster recent attempts at sending up old horror and science fiction films like lost skeleton of cadavra and alien trespass are kind of rendered moot when you have films like crater lake monster available for screening  it s the sort of film that those films spoof and send up only this is the real deal  its everything those films try to be only with out the tongue in cheek and its so much more fun because of it  this is a real drive in sort of film that had the unfortunate luck of coming just as star wars changed the way we look at special effects  the monster  a mix of stop motion and a life size head  is a charmingly quaint little beast  the filmmakers spoil the audience with frequent shots of the monster and its mayhem  sure its clear that its all fake  but isn t movies about suspension of disbelief  actually i think its about really cool monsters  which this has i like this movie in a low budget drive in sort of a way  if you want a real authentic drive in monster movie look not_farther  this would be perfect for a double or triple feature with similar lake monster films  boggy creek etc,1,0,0.34928747877519
the movie actually has a fairly good story  but gets bogged down in several key places  it s almost as if the director threw the movie together without taking the time to make some essential cuts in the film  dennis quaid does a fairly decent job in his role    but something is clearly missing from several key scenes this 2 5 hour movie could have been reduced to about a 2 hour movie  and probably would have been a much better film had it not_had the feel as if it was thrown together,1,0,0.31800015097113765
these are excerpts from a nine page  memo to mr  cohn from mr  welles   written after orson had seen studio mogul harry cohn s edited version of the picture  he took an hour out       the preview title music was written by a first rate composer  george antheil  although not_written for our picture at all  this temporary title music had an atmosphere of darkness and menace combined with something lush and romantic which made it acceptable   the only musical idea which seems to have occurred to this present composer  heinz roemheld  is the rather weary one of using a popular song  the  theme   in as many arrangements as possible  throughout we have musical references to  please don t kiss me  for almost every bridge and also for a great deal of the background material  the tune is pleasing  it may do very well on the hit parade  but lady from shanghai is not_a musical comedy   mr  roemheld is an ardent devotee of an old fashioned type of scoring now referred to in our business as  disney   in other words  if somebody falls down  he makes a  falling down  sound in the orchestra  etc   etc   if the lab had scratched initials and phone numbers all over the negative  i couldn t be unhappier about the results   just before i left to go abroad  i asked vi  viola lawrence  the editor  to make a cut which would involve dropping the near accident with the taxi cab and also quite a bit of dialogue  i am convinced that this would have been an excellent cut   saving much needed footage in the slow opening sequence  this was not_done  accounting for the main weaknesses of the film s opening reel    there is nothing in the fact of rita s diving to warrant a big orchestral crescendo   what does matter is rita s beauty   the evil overtones suggested by grigsby s character  and michael s bewilderment  any or all of these items might have inspired the music  instead  the dive is treated as though it were a major climax or some antic moment in a silly symphony  a pratfall by pluto the pup  or a wild jump into space by donald duck   there is not_sound atmosphere on the boat  a little wind and water is sorely missed  there s not_point in photographing a scene on a real boat if you make it sound as though it all happened in front of a process screen   at the start of the picnic sequence   in the temporary score  we used a very curious  sexy latin american strain   this has been replaced with a corny  dramatic  sequel  bad stock stuff   this sort of music destroys that quality of strangeness which is exactly what might have saved lady from shanghai from being just another whodunit   there is a big musical outburst after grigsby s line   i want you to kill him   this is absurd   the hawaiian guitar music which comes out of the radio   was supposed to be corny enough to make a certain satirical point  as it stands now  it s on about the same level as the rest of the scoring  nobody in the audience could possibly suspect that we re kidding   the aquarium scene needs more echo   please don t kiss me  is in again    a bad dubbing job and poor scoring has destroyed the character of michael s run down the pier  from the gunshot through to the phone call  a careful pattern of voices had been built up with the expenditure of much time and effort  for some reason  this has all been junked in favor of a vague hullabaloo  as a result  the whole sequence seems dull   the audience should feel at this point  along with michael  that maybe they are going crazy  the new dubbing job can only make them feel that maybe they re going to sleep   the gun battle with the breaking mirrors must not_be backed with music   the closing music again makes reference to  please don t kiss me    this finale is obvious to the point of vulgarity  and does incalculable injury to the finish of the picture  all of these edits from orson were ignored,1,0,0.1746644766293541

kidnappings in mexico are as common as honeys giving me their phone numbers so if you re rich then you ll need a good bodyguard to keep you and your kids safe  a couple hires a washed up bodyguard called creasy to protect their adorable kid pita  at first  their relationship is a tad buggy but after a while  creasy eases up to the girl and the two develop a father daughter relationship  one day pita is kidnapped and creasy is badly injured in the process  when he wakes up he finds out that the girl has been killed due to a ransom negotiations that went wrong and this sets creasy on a path find the men responsible for her death and make sure they are brought to his brand of justice  keep some tylenol next to you while watching this movie because you will need to take some after watching it  i really love the story here of going to the extreme to obtain revenge because most movies usually just want revenge but really not_go too far where as this movie they show how far a man can go to do what he feels is right  the only problem is the annoying visual style  which will either make you hate the movie or hate tony scott  i really feel sorry for the cinematographer because i m sure he came into this movie thinking he was going to be filming an action movie and probably got all excited but instead he got stuck being the dp for a filmmaker that feels that the whole movie should look like it s been possessed by demons  i wouldn t have mind if the crappy visuals were restricted to a few action scenes but when it s spread through out the whole movie then that s when we have some problems  the same annoying style was recently used on  domino  and much like with this movie the style did hurt that otherwise great movie  another person i feel sorry on this movie was the soon to be great harry gregson williams who had the impossible task of trying to compose music out of the jagged images  somehow  williams wrote some decent music for the movie but i m sure if the movie had been more stable then the music would have turned out a lot better  the sound is wrongfully used throughout the movie and instead of enhancing the movie experience  it rather makes you feel like you re being punished  the overuse of the subwoofer is irritating as every 5 seconds or so you can hear an ungodly low end sound coming out of it  i don t know why scott thought the audience needed to be bombarded by the subwoofer but it really takes you away from the movie  the acting in the movie is a beast despite the visuals  little fanning does yet another great job here and the scene at the end of the movie just breaks my heart  if the end of the movie doesn t make anyone cry then they re dead on the inside  denzel washington breaks his rule of not_making any action movies with this movie and luckily  for him he gets to play a great character  the whole idea of a man that s lost in life and all of a sudden due to a tragedy finds a purpose in his life is nothing new but washington brings some heart and emotion to the otherwise flat character  i love how we witness him from being a loner to actually learning to have emotion and after the kidnapping becoming a cold instrument of revenge  radha mitchell plays marc anthony s wife and she along with fanning are the two reasons why i can t hate the movie too much  j lo s husband comes and goes in the movie but he doesn t really stand out much  mickey rourke and chris walken all have minimal roles in the movie but they do make an impact  one thing that makes me laugh is how the filmmakers try to makeup for the crappy way they portray mexico by calling it a fine city at the end of the movie  a little too late for that if you ask me  let s hope that tony scott is done with this phase of intentionally trying to ruin his career because a filmmaker as talented as him can and must do better than this,1,0,0.35197687163466695

the reason why i say this is because i wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until i was asked to see the film  i wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me  because alan dobie was a friend of mine  i got to hear about it  i had only written a first draft so i was understandably worried when i heard that it was on the floor  i asked peter collinson  through my agent  whether he might like me to do another draft  i also asked if i could i see my original script because i had lost it  i was told  too late  so i did the only thing i could do under the circumstances and took my name off  i had not_idea what they might have done to my screenplay  then i was invited to see the finished film  i was so impressed that i very quickly asked to have my name put back on  it s a beautifully made piece  from a hurriedly written first draft  i expected to be asked to do much more work on it  perhaps if i had it wouldn t be so good  i would love to see my original script again if anybody knows where it is  i would also love to see the film again  i only saw it once in a little viewing theatre in soho,1,0,0.32522472891232096

tim krabbe is the praised author of  het gouden ei   a novel that was put on the screen twice   spoorloos  and  the vanishing    one of the dutch writer s more recent works is  de grot   a psychological thriller about two totally different men  egon and axel  who meet at a youth camp and  surprising enough  become friends for dear life  egon is a quiet  somewhat dull person  who spends his time studying and writing geography books  axel  on the other hand  is a charismatic  party animal   a heavy drinking criminal whose everyday s concern is to get a woman into his bedroom  from the moment they meet  axel has a strong influence on egon  while the latter envies him because he has a good life without really doing anything  such as reading thick books like egon   ultimately  egon is even dragged by egon into illegal practices himself  which leads to a fatal drug transport in a distant asian country after having read the book last year  i was surprised the critics were quite positive about it  in my opinion  the book suffers especially from the complex structure  while krabbe presents the story as an absorbing portrait of an uncommon relationship between two people  the plot becomes more of a puzzle  the many episodes are not_presented chronologically  so that two successive scenes are seldom in the same episode  because of this  the story feels surprisingly remote  you often need to know a character s background to really care for him or her  another complaint was the fact that the main characters  egon and axel  are a little stereotypical  egon is  the  dull intellectual  while axel is his exact opposite  in real life  such one dimensional people rarely exist  in books and films  they always seem to be there  taking away a lot of credibility despite all this  the film was a pleasant surprise  being much better than the book  the adaptation excels in its beautiful cinematography  humour and acting  fedja van huet  egon  is one of the few dutch actors who can make you forget he is acting  which is  in my opinion  the highest an actor can achieve   the drawbacks of the film  however  are the same as the book s  mainly because the characters are one dimensional  they are so predictable that it becomes annoying  guess who wrote the script  indeed  krabbe himself  it is obvious that this talented director  that s what the movie makes clear anyway  is hampered by a deficient screenplay  perhaps koolhoven should just have chosen a better book 7 10,1,0,0.31799612777657993

i m not_sure that this comment contains an actual spoiler  but i m playing it safe  so don t read this if you haven t seen the movie i adore this movie  and so does everyone i work with    and that is the point  i spent a large part of my working life in cinema  without being an actor  such people are the _sung_ heroes of this movie  the gaffers  the pullers  the on air directors  the lighters and writers  the costume people etc etc  and the whole thing is told from their point of view  at least to a great extent  most actors are nuts and self absorbed to the point of absurdity  which is what this movie spoofs so well  but you have to have worked with actors to recognize that this movie is real life drama  possible spoiler alert  in one great scene  the two leads  both actors  are _discussing_ how to _discuss_ something personal  something entirely  out of script   with another actor  and they start making up lines  rehearsing them  and critiquing each other s performance since this movie appeared in  what was it   91  it has become fashionable to do this  especially on tv  but hardly anyone has done it so well,1,0,0.3078330587807994
let s get some things straight first  zombies don t exist so the filmmaker can have them walk  run  hell even fly if he wants to  that s what makes this original zombie movie so good  everything they did was so damn original  i hate it when filmmakers do everything like romero or when fan boys expect everything like romero  some idiots think that zombies should only growl like a typical romero movie  once again zombies don t exist so a filmmaker can make zombies whistle if he wants  the zombies in this movie all look very good but obviously they are not_decaying corpses since they just freaking died  they are pretty messed up though and full of chopped faces and blood  one of the coolest scenes was a half eaten cat  it looked so damn real my daughter cried when she saw it  this movie got really good reviews in fangoria and rue morgue so that made me want to go see it  i m glad i listened  they are always right when it comes to real horror fan s tastes  10 out of 10  go rent it,1,0,0.10954811663583626
well  well    roeg touched a bit of a nerve there  didn t he  he was a genius while he was cataloguing his various characters  descents into psychosis for a couple of decades  but as soon as he has the bad taste to suggest that redemption  or even some good advice  might be found in the bad old catholic church  the hipper than thou alternative movie crowd gets extra vicious  worse still  theresa russell s character   faced with experiences that nothing in her avowedly rationalist outlook has an explanation for  is unwillingly forced to deal with those experiences on another level   that of the spiritual  you know  the realm of the ignorant and superstitious  the sort of thing that the art house cinephiles are supposed to be above  oh  the horror    so she finds her marriage   the idea that it might be a uniquely important commitment   affirmed by what seems uncomfortably like divine intervention  people who find this idea prima facie offensive could maybe ask themselves why they instinctively jump into attack mode at being challenged to take seriously the idea of a spiritual dimension to their lives  but they probably won t  sure  this film has some problems  notably talia shire s delirious hamwork as the overwrought nun  1950s style attire and all  and the dialogue between marie davenport and the young priest in their last scene is straight out of the spellbound school of glib interpretations  though hitchcock s movie escaped similar charges due to the source of wisdom having impeccably secular credentials as a freudian psychoanalyst   but  sadly  nicolas roeg appears to have copped a critical mauling as much for even asking the question as for the possible answers this film presents,1,0,0.12307775992893522
so halfway through the season  i got so caught up in school and my activities that i didn t realize that the show had been canceled halfway through  which is crap i think the followers of this show should write fox and ask them to at least finish filming so that a the season can be released on dvd later  maybe then they ll see how many people were disappointed that the show didn t survive its first season i loved the show and looked forward to it every thursday after the oc  can you imagine my disappointment when i came back to try and watch the show only to discover that it had disappeared  needless to say  i m not_very happy with fox right now  even more so after discovering that not_ending was filmed  i mean  if you re going to work on a project  at least finish it to see what happens  a half filmed show is like a half made car  it s pretty much useless  fox  film the damn ending and give some of the show s fans some peace,1,0,0.33003299509227985
i really liked batman  dead end  i thought that it had a theatrical feel to it and that given a chance collora could make a fine film  this trailer didn t quite give me the same impression  the story line  or potential story line  was quite good but due to the acting and special effects left me feeling like this would have made a good tv movie or television show first  michael o hearn is not_that good a superman  i actually thought he  in his brief appearance  made a decent clark kent  sorry  i just don t think of superman as being that buff  the suit kent wore masked his size  batman may have the body of a bodybuilder but not_superman  supes is toned not_doubt but not_bulk  anyway  i didn t care for all his posing and his transformation from kent to superman seemed cheezy  now this may not_be just o hearn s fault  collora may have to take some of the credit for poor scripting and direction second  the special effects for flying were cheezy  superman flies through the sky  if was obvious that this superman flew close to the ground  with the telephone cables and buildings visible above him  i don t think there were any full body shots of superman flying  evidently the harness and rigging supporting o hearn must have been located on his lower torso all in all it was a good trailer  i d probably pay to see a film  if ever made  and would be sure to catch it on television  the story line  an alliance between lexcorp and wayne industries  superman jealous of lois s attraction to wayne  lex and twoface teaming to beat superman and the joining of forces between batman   superman is a good one  i m sure with a larger budget and approval for a full film collora and company  even o hearn could deliver a decent film  certainly one better than the most of the comic based crap coming out of hollywood lately,1,0,0.30696430560215787

hardly a masterpiece  not_so well written  beautiful cinematography i think not_this movie wasn t too terrible but it wasn t that much better than average  the main story dealing with highly immoral teens should have focused more on the forbidden romance and why this was    should have really gotten into it instead of scraping the surface with basically  because mom says we can t   some parts should have been dropped altogether or reworked to have more importance to the plight of the two main characters  couple times i was wondering if the writer director was a fan of george lucas  classic american graffiti  not_that it s wrong to be a fan of that movie but to make your movie at times look like that  i mean come on  worst part of this was that madchen amick had such a small part  i mean double come on   she was the only one  in one or two lines  who actually tried a southern accent   take a good listen  it was there even though her character was from california  doh    maybe if she was the star others could have followed and we would have had a more authentically sounding movie  oh well  what can ya do when you have a director who s just a director and not_an artist  also  too bad  overall i give this a b  and that s being a little generous  cause i m partial to ms  amick,1,0,0.06868981039367945
honestly  i was expecting to hate this one  and really only checked it out because jenna jameson is in it   but i have to say i got a kick out of evil breed  a group of college kids and their teacher go on a  field trip  to ireland  their lodgings are located near the woods where it is rumored that strange things happen and tourists often disappear without a trace  the group of post teens is warned by the property s caretaker not_to venture into the woods   but being the stupid b movie characters that they are   of course they pay not_attention and pay for their mistake one by one    first off  there is plenty wrong with evil breed  the acting dialog is pretty weak  and my major gripe is that a film that has jenna jameson  chasey lain  ginger lynn  and taylor hayes should have far more gratuitous nudity than was on display here   and jenna s role in this production is grossly over hyped  as she has a combined total of about 2 minutes of screen time  even less with chasey  and ginger lynn shows not_skin and has the worst irish accent ever  also the last scene of the film makes absolutely not_sense and feels like it s thrown in just to end the film  those gripes aside   there is some good stuff as well  richard greico and chasey lain are both dispatched early on  with greico s nude torso ending up on a roasting spit and chasey s guts hanging out from being torn in half  though how she ends up this way isn t shown on screen    not_bad for the first 5 minutes  the other kill scenes are pretty inventive  including jenna s forced breast implant removal  a guy getting his colon pulled out through his ass  a knife through the face  and a few other notables  the implant and colon scenes also have uncut versions that are on the special features and it s a shame the producers made them chop  em  so to speak  also the film moves along at a pretty good clip once it gets moving so you don t really have too much time to be bored  the  creature  fx are also done competently which definitely helps  overall  evil breed was not_as bad as i expected  this one  along with satan s little helper have almost renewed my interest in american low budget straight to video films  i usually steer clear of them as a whole  but these two have been decent enough to give me some faith  evil breed is not_masterpiece  but it is a decent way to blow 90 minutes   might not_hurt to suck on a bottle of cheap bourbon while you re at it   i know i was  and i m sure it didn t hurt the experience  7 5 10,1,0,0.056386115424525665

i can tell you just how bad this movie is  i was in the movie and i haven t seen it yet  but i cringe at the thought of anyone actually paying to see me drunk  especially considering what we did that year  the thing is that they probably over edited it  especially the scene where my roommate was snorting coke of the tits of a mexican prostitute  they probably should have followed him around   we made a few come and go appearances but aside from that i can t really remember anything  i was the mc in a few scenes  from what i m told  what i can tell you is that everyone avoided the camera crew since who wants to be remembered as the guy who threw up or the girl who showed her tits to the world  or the girl that loser lost his virginity to   overall the trip itself was crazy but people act different once the camera is on them,1,0,0.35997329379480947
i watched this on an 8 hour flight and  presumably because of the pressure and the altitude  i actually found it mildly entertaining  emphasis on the  mild   the actual idea behind the film was brilliant  a woman dies  her fianc√© falls in love with someone else  she decided to make sure they don t get together  but eventually she lets them do it  sadly the actual film wasn t as good  ok  there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well  but from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight i was on  i think the whole gay but not_gay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better  the talking parrot was a nice idea but to be honest  it wasn t really very funny in summary the film was more interesting than staring at the seat in front of me  but it was a close call,1,0,0.19533495938464354

dolph lundgren is back  detention marks dolphs first film in nearly 2 years  and that is following the delayed hidden agenda  this film still marks an improvement for dolph over his cheapie trilogy of jill rips  agent red and stormcatcher  however this film is well below the standard of hidden agenda  which was better in almost every respect  what this film does have in it s favour from dolph s previous outing  is a sense of cheesy fun  the film also has a rejuvenated dolph back in a high action role  and it s good to see dolph doing his own stunts again the films story is ludicrous and prime b movie material  an ex military man is now a teacher and on his last day of teaching  whilst taking a detention class  he runs into some slovakian bad guys who have taken over the school to use as cover for a big drug deal  the film has not_originality but in a movie of this type you need to have a sense of fun with all the cliches  if you take it too seriously the audience will find little to enjoy  thankfully the filmmakers don t take matters too seriously and along with all the action cliches you can think of and the predictability  this film has a so bad it s enjoyable kind of vibe where the film is let down is miss using a fairly decent budget  the budget of around 10 million has not_been well spent  it s all up on screen with plenty of carnage and big explosions but a lot of the shootouts lack imagination  the opening action is okay but after that the good moments become more sparse  there are some good moments  you have a car careering through school hallways for example and a decent shootout at the beginning  with plenty of destruction  the rest of the shootouts are fairly mechanical but there is plenty going on onscreen  as for the cast  hidden agenda boasted the best cast dolph has worked with in ages  there was a good standard of actors for a dtv film  this however has problems  the actors are on the most part bad  the bad guys are terrible  but the lead bad guy has a kind of enjoyable cheesiness because alex karsis plays it so over the top and without the hint of any menace that you can laugh at the pure badness  the teenagers of the piece are actually good but they are playing such cliched characters  they all hate authority  each other and all have bad attitudes and of course by the end they learn important life lessons  but generally they are decent and chris collins in particular has a likeability  this movie is all about dolph though  while this film is nowhere near his best  it is nowhere near his worst  it also marks a turning point in his career  he is now back in good shape  and will be in even better shape in his next film direct action  dolph looks enthusiastic here  he does all his own stunts and it is good to see him play the typical action man  running from explosions in slow mo  one liners  and handling large weapons  again in a movie like his older ones  albeit with less flair and imagination than cliched films like army of one  it is good to see dolph looking energised  his films of the last 8 or so years have seen dolph looking a little more weary  and using doubles a lot  he still does all the fights himself though  but the new streamlined dolph seems up for it overall this is watchable if only for the cheese value and dolph in prime action man mode  there s not_a single surprise but it has a laughably inept kind of charm,1,0,0.28176916085731674

i saw two movies over the weekend  one was  kaal  and the other  waqt   both movies are made in  bollywood  but they are worlds apart  the fundamental difference is the story and the director  vipul shaw made his indelible mark with  ankhen   one of the best comedy hindi movies  his casting of the charecteres is perfect  the story apparently taken from a gujerati play is awesome the treatment is superb with some exceptions  in bollywood when a movie is put together the first thing a bollywood director is prone to do is sign up a music director and this guy  mediocre malik in this instance is obligated to drum up six songs to fulfill his contract  so even a good director like vipul shah has to use them to appease the finacier and the grandma s who just cant get enough of these numbers  not_music director can churn out good songs relentlessly as clearly evident in this movie  none of the songs have any melody and they are clearly intrusive to the narration of the story except the background music and the westernized version of the bharat natyam  the duelling and role playing the father and son is good acting by bachachan and akshay kumar  his stunt scenes are clearly outstanding  a good director surrounds himself with good actors and he is willing to wait till a good story comes along as in this super movie  then we have a cheap classless tasteless producer like sharukh khan who will stoop low as to shamelessly plug and promote a trash like  kaal  to enrich himself at the cost of the betterment of art  and they surround themselves with borderline talent  and they recoup the investment before the word gets around  these are the bollywood locusts who prey on the unsuspected audience to garner  film farce  awards given by bollywood chamcha s and most of them are in the media,1,0,0.3085912024312071

sometimes they get lucky and have a hit on their hands  wayne s world  the first one  not_the second   but most often they have duds  it s pat comes to mind rather quickly   this time out it s tim meadows as the ladies man  this movie falls somewhere in between a hit and a dud  it was very funny for the first 20 minutes  but then  as usually happens with snl skits  it starts to slow down  before finally ending  long after it should have tim meadows is leon phelps  a radio dj with a nightly show called the ladies man  he answers any and all questions dealing with sex and relationships  usually in the crudest way possible  everything seems to ultimately come down to the butt  after pushing the buttons of the station manager  leon  along with his producer julie  karyn parsons  gets fired  and needs to find another job  out of the random blue  comes a letter from one of his ex ladies  the letter offers him wealth and luxury for the rest of his life  the only problem being that the letter isn t signed  so leon needs to track down all the women he s been with to find the woman of his dreams  but sometimes  as billy dee williams says in the film  the woman of your dreams is standing right in front of you  there is also a sub plot about a bunch of guys who s wives girlfriends have all slept with leon  and they want to first figure out who he is  by a tattoo he has on a part of his anatomy   then kill him  leading this bunch of guys is  surprise  will ferrell from snl  first off  i thought the sub plot was rather lame  the singing and dancing stuff was just completely worthless  i usually like will ferrell but here he just not_clicked for me  and the rest of the guys were just schlubs who tagged along  and in the end all decided that having their wives girlfriends cheat on them was in fact their fault  so back to the main story  the story basically centers around leon and sex  so what it comes down to is  if you don t like the character of leon  you won t like the movie  his voice  his mannerisms  his dialogue is what carries the movie  i am not_a big fan of tim meadows  i not_thought he was a particularly good actor on snl  the only thing i ever really liked of his  was his ladies man skits  but the best thing about those  is that they usually involved the guest host  remember the one with cameron diaz    and they were short  for about 5 minutes  they were pretty funny  and here  for about 20 minutes  it s really funny  what i thought was good about the character in the movie  is that he stayed in character throughout  he not_wavered from his wanted to just get laid persona  until right at the end where there was this transformation  and the ever present speech to tie things up  other than that  it was pretty good at keeping leon as leon  and not_changing him into something less crude than he was  there isn t a lot of substance to this movie  if you couldn t guess  but like i said earlier  the beginning of the movie i found to be very funny  some real laugh out loud moments  all revolving around sex and his crudeness  the problem of course with this movie  and most other snl spin offs  is that these are characters that are only supposed to be shown for a few minutes at a time  stretching the concept into 80 minutes is very difficult  that difficulty is obviously why they needed the sub plot  because without it  this movie would have been a little under an hour  when it was good  it was good  but when it wasn t good  it got to be boring so overall  the ladies man wasn t as bad as other snl films  but it wasn t as good as others  it had some funny moments  the first 20 minutes was pretty good  but the rest of it dragged on  there was an unnecessary sub plot whose only purpose was to lengthen the film  the bottom line is  if you like tim meadows and his leon phelps character  you ll be able to watch the film  if he annoys you  don t even bother going  unless you just want to see tiffani theissen in some nice revealing clothing,1,0,0.11451359013626233

just two comments    seven years apart  hardly evidence of the film s relentless pulling power  as has been mentioned  the low budget telemovie status of 13 gantry row is a mitigating factor in its limited appeal  having said that however the thing is not_without merit   either as entertainment or as a fright outing per se true  the plot at its most basic is a re working of the amityville horror   only without much horror  more a case of intrigue  gibney might have made a more worthwhile impression if she had played halifax  investigating a couple of seemingly unconnected murders with the  house  as the main suspect  the script is better than average and the production overall of a high standard  it just fails to engage the viewer particularly at key moments having picked the dvd up for a mere  3 95 last week at my regular video store  i cannot begrudge the expenditure   10 95 would be an acceptable price for the film  just don t expect fireworks,1,0,0.18564840869558233

what do you do with a 14 inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder  and then died of aids  you make a movie  of course  the probable reason why it wasn t made earlier is the fact that eddie nash would have been in the way of its production  so it s not_coincidence that the film was made just a little while after nash was sent to prison the best thing about the movie is its quick pace  there is not_time wasted on unnecessary crap  and why would it be  there is too much good material here to require dull filler scenes the cast is good  kilmer has been mediocre in a string of movies  so here was finally a role quite suitable for him  bosworth is cute so it s irrelevant how she acts  she s solid   and mcdermott  who is otherwise quite annoying  is rather good  to a large extent because he is wearing so much facial hair that i didn t recognize him at first   i wish they did that to cruise in every movie so i wouldn t have to watch his dumb face   i utterly failed to recognize christina applegate  and wouldn t have known she was in it  had i not_seen her name in the end credits  kudrow is charming as ever  a bit unusual to see her in a dramatic role   btw   friends  is the worst tv sitcom of all time   the only casting choices that were questionable were an early near cameo by carrie fischer and the totally absurd inclusion of the 90s moron janeane garofalo  you thought i d include paris hilton  too  didn t you  not_i think hilton is the ideal choice in her 10 second appearance as a dumb whore  because the film is about decadence  among other things   and about a porn actor   she fits in perfectly,1,0,0.12888075909776267

this did for crime what  not_another teen movie  did for school  i laughed all the way through as 2 inept gangs warred with each other and among themselves  an unsubtle comedy using overt jokes and gags that kept me rolling all the way  i suppose the biggest gag in the entire film was that time not_seemed to go forward leaving the characters trapped in the 30 s,1,0,0.1682432169790281
i rented the film  i don t think it got a theatrical release here  out expecting the worse  the previews made the film look awful  i was in fact very surprised  it was well worth watching  it was loosely scripted  almost like an ensemble piece of film  it had some very funny moments in it and although flawed is an effective satire on the show and the people on the show without being too scathing  it is flawed  mainly by the awful soundtrack of bludgeoning  comedy  effects but on the whole it comes across as honest and generally true to form of the show in an altmanesque or larry sanders way at the moment it is the fashion to be critical of jerry springer  he is also an easy target  springer could have made citizen kane and it would be proclaimed  the worst film ever made   i recommend this film for anybody interested in the show  a flawed but innovative and interesting piece of film,1,0,0.3375100381825136
there s so many things to fall for in aro tolbukhin  en la mente del asesino  inside the killer s mind   that it s very hard to talk about it without giving any kind of warning  let s just say that this movie is like an exercise in cinema but really  really great done  it s made with super 8  black and white shots  35 milimeters  color  interviews  flashbacks  aro tolbukhin it s like a movie made a documental or viceversa  which most peculiar aspect relays on the doubt that leaves you wondering  did he really ever existed  the movie follows the later life of an hungarian sailor that arrived in guatemala  worked in a religious mission and then killed some people  an act for which he got caught and death penalty sentenced  the movie starts because some french documentalists got interested in this character so they interview him prior to his death  nowadays  some more people got involved and make a deeper research of the character  the one we are witness of  the movie for the main part in the history we are guided by a semi slow phase to go look inside aro s mind  mainly in order to decode why he did what he has done  nevertheless  the important thing is that the filmmakers not_gives us a sided point of view  they left the judging for all of us and even as we may understand his actions  we clearly not_justify them  so  the first half is based upon recollecting information  later things turn into aro s childhood  giving the movie such an incredible new force  even tough not_got weak or boring  i don t mean  and don t want  to spoil anything  so the only thing left to say is that if by any chance you get this movie near you  believe me  the trip to see it is more than worthy,1,0,0.2855710919848469
i love kristen dunst  especially in elizabethtown  i guess she s the kind of actress who had better not_act before camera  but just be herself  she did that  and she looked so natural in elizabethtown  in this movie  however  she did try to add in more artificial performance  especially in the first half of the film  so that she looked more like a sober editor  while in the other half  she totally set herself back in her daily track  and i just couldn t tell her to be an editor any way  therefore  her performance is not_enduring in this film  the film on the whole  is attracting and inspiring  the character of young is full and reasonable  anyway  the film tells a big and sophisticated story  the only big defect is that it didn t show a turning point of the hero and heroine s love story  i am totally confused when they kiss at the end of the story  because that is rather unclear for the two persons,1,0,0.23235578145426644
after reading the book  i happened across this dvd at wal mart for 3 bucks and thought  sure  what the hell    i got the dvd and watched it last night  when i started watching it  i checked the run time and it was about 90 minutes  i thought  ok cool    it seemed to run rather slowly  knowing the story and how much of it there was  by the time i got to the actual killings  i was like   how much time does this have left   checked   one minute   what the hell    i felt incredibly cheated  thinking that the movie only progressed through a third of the overall story but then  i happily noticed that the dvd s scene selection menu included a part 1 and a part 2  i still had another hour and a half to go  i then sat very happily and enjoyed the second half of the movie  even more so than the first i admit that i have not_seen the 1967 original film  despite my sincerest desire to   i have however read the novel and felt that this was a fairly descent film  for a two part tv miniseries  that is  i think the casting of the role of perry was completely wrong and a few minor inconsistencies jumped out at me  but still very well done  the first half drags on a bit  while the second half is much more gripping  i think they should have proportioned the movie more like capote did his book  1 3 before the murders  1 3 after  and 1 3 after the killers are arrested  instead  the film makes it more 1 2 before the murders  1 4 after  and 1 4 after the killers are arrested  again  this makes the second half more exciting  but at the same time  less compelling while making the first half drag on and on   now i look back and realize i have just made the same mistake about making things drag on and on  so i will shut the hell up  go watch the movie and make up your own damn mind  nick houston,1,0,0.2243543832845877
after 16 years tim burton finally disappoints me     whatever happened to the old burton who read  the dark knight returns  by frank miller as research for his preparation to direct batman back in 1988 89  by the looks of it burton didn t research the book nor the movie cause he got everything wrong  this movie sucks  it s not_as good as the original and it doesn t deal with the same subject as the original  if you want a good ape movie watch the original   out of    stars,1,0,0.12959025985095754
wizards of the lost kingdom is a movie about a young prince  simon  who is banished from his kingdom due to his father  the king  being killed by the cliche  evil adviser   this movie s about simon s adventures  the special effects  plot  acting  and generally everything about this movie is bad  however  it s so bad that it s funny  you will keep watching this movie simply because it s so bad it s funny  and  like the other reviewer of the movie said  it s so bad it s good,1,0,0.06568222414440443
i think this movie got a low rating because it got judged by it s worst moments  there is a diarrhea joke and an embarrassing nut scratching scene  but apart from that there are actually quite a few moments that made me laugh out loud  jason lee is performing some wonderfully subtle comedy in this movie and julia stiles manages to be pretty damn funny herself  apart from that this movie behaves like most romantic comedies  after about 40 minutes into it you know how it is going to end   which is better than most of them  where you already know after     5 minutes   anyway  better movies to watch but definitely not_the worst pick   cheers,1,0,0.20153177450564955
i scooped up this title by accident with the grindhouse vol  1 collection of pure euro trash movies  but this movie has a nice stamp of approval and should deserve a better transfer than what is out there  stupednous it is not_satisfying it is  watching this movie i couldn t help to wonder    how come sergio martino didn t make this flick  this has his signature all over it and punctuated by edwedge fenech  alas not_as well known as she should be but she did get a nice cameo in hostel ii   double crosses and triple crosses underly and cement this film from beginning to end with lee van cleef oozing coolness under pressure from the 1st second  did this guy have to go to italy to finally reach his potential or did the studio system let this guy slip through  besides lee s more recognizable films  film goers should try this on for size and see how if sergio leone would ve lowered his epic scale down on once upon a time in america to half the running time  and 1 4 of the budget  this is what it would ve turned out to be like  so refreshing  it should be taken in during the day at home and make it for an couch matin√©e,1,0,0.1466961137533994
even though there are not_new episodes  and it is rarely showed  i used to love the magic of sabrina and the teenage witch  i not_got to see the last episodes  but i do want to know what happened to miles  or josh  and why did the aunts have to disappear out of the show for good i m sure the ending went to be perfect  but there are a lot of questions unanswered  and i want to see the last episode of s t t w  because i heard she decides between erin and harvey on her wedding day  i really hope that she picks harvey  and may i say nate richart is hott   too bad hes too old for me though  melissa joan hart has her own sense of cuteness that she adds to the show  but there are many little  stupid  things for the show such as how famous bands come out of nowhere and play songs and all the cast is listening  its kind of stupid  plus the cat starts to really get lame  as the show continued  the jokes began just to get stupid  and the things that the audio controlled  audience  would laugh at  i would think it was so lame  don t get me wrong  at some parts it was funny  but i think the show just kind of lost its  magic  so to speak as the show went on  i give kudos to all the cast though for trying  although that soleil moon frye girl had not_taste  and she was a horrid actress  i wonder what melissa or any of the cast is doing now for that matter  now that the show has ended,1,0,0.2729221895491212
okay  i didn t get the purgatory thing the first time i watched this episode  it seemed like something significant was going on that i couldn t put my finger on  this time those costa mesa fires on tv really caught my attention  and it helped that i was just writing an essay on inferno  but let me see what hasn t been discussed yet   a twop review mentioned that tony had 7 flights of stairs to go down because of the broken elevator  yeah  7 is a significant number for lots of reasons  especially religious  but here s one more for ya  on a hunch i consulted wikipedia  and guess what dante divided into 7 levels  purgatorio  excluding ante purgatory and paradise   the stuff at the bottom of the stairs and    what tony can t get to   on to the allegedly  random  monk slap scene  as soon as the monks appeared  it fit perfectly in place with tony trying to get out of purgatory  you can tell he got worried when that christian commercial  death  disease  and sin  came on  and he s getting more and more desperate because christian heaven is looking kinda iffy for him  by the time he meets the monks he s thinking  hey maybe these guys can help me   which sounds like contemplating other religions  e g  buddhism  and wondering if some other path could take him to  salvation   not_that tony is necessarily literally thinking about becoming a buddhist  but it appears finnerty tried that  and messed up   that slap in the face basically tells tony there s not_quick fix  as in  not_you can t suddenly embrace buddhism and get out of here  tony was initially not_too concerned about getting to heaven  but at the  conference entrance   he realizes that s not_going to be so easy for him  at first i saw the name vs  driver s license problem as tony having led sort of a double life  what with the killing people and sleeping around that he kept secret from most people  he feels free to have an affair with quasi melfi because  he s kevin finnerty   he figures out that he can fool some people with kf s cards  like hotel receptionists  but it won t get him out of purgatory  those helicopters  the helicopters of heaven   are keeping track of him and everything he does after reading all the theories on  infinnerty   though  it seems like kf s identity is a reminder of the infinite different paths tony could ve taken in his life  possibly along with the car joke involving infiniti s that made not_sense to me otherwise  aaaand at that point my brain fizzles out,1,0,0.35355170702182365
as a sequel this is not_a bad movie i actually liked it better than the 1st one i found it more entertaining it seemed like it was shot documentary style at first this bothered me as i thought it just looked too low budget but it grew on me and it made the movie seem more authentic this movie has more dry one liners than the original which is a good thing in my opinion i do think at times they went a bit over the top with some of the scenes and the characters it almost becomes a parody of itself which may be the point this movie at least has some suspense which the 1st one did not_have in my view it has some of the same great music from the original which is great the acting again was pretty decent for the most part though like i said some of it seemed over the top i also felt that the movie loses a lot of momentum towards the end and there are a few minutes which seem really slow and just don t seem to flow like the rest of the movie overall though i thought this was a pretty sequel my rating for  return to cabin by the lake  is 7 10,1,0,0.2596988545860493
time for a rant  eh  i thought spirit was a great movie to watch  however  there were a few things that stop me from rating it higher than a 6 or 7  i m being a little bit generous with the 7  point  1  matt damon aggravates me  i was thinking   what a dicky voice they got for the main character   when i first heard him narrate   and then i realized it is matt damon  the man bugs me so very bad   his performance in  the departed  was terrible and ruined the movie for me  before the movie got a chance to ruin itself  but that s another story for some other time   as it almost did  spirit   i was able to get past this fact because of how little narration there actually was    thankfully point  2  brian adams sucks    the whole score was terrible    the songs were unoriginal  generic  and poorly executed  not_once did i find the music to fit  and the lyrics were terrible  every time one of the lame songs came on  i was turned off  i almost thought i d start hearing some patriotic propaganda slipped into the super american freedom style lyrics  i couldn t help but be reminded of those terrible patriotic songs that played on the radio constantly after 9 11   in light of the native american aspects of the film  they should have gone with fitting music using right instruments  not_petty radio hit  teen bop  14 year old girl crap  i thought i was back in junior high school  i can t believe not_better could have been done  i refuse to  had it not_have been for this  i d rank the film up more with disney  which knows a thing or two about originality  ok  don t bother saying what i know some of you are probably thinking     too bad  it s a shame they couldn t have hired better musicians i liked the art and animation  except for some things here and there    like sometimes the angles appear too sharp on the face and the lines too thick or dark on the body  thick dark lines mainly near the end   there were often times when i thought they _tried too hard_ on the emotion and facial expressions and failed at drawing any real emotion  but there were also times when the emotion ran thick  anyhow  many scenes were lazy and the layers were apparent ok  i m falling asleep here so i ll sum it up before i start making less sense   nice try on an epic film    it turned out mediocre though  matt damon  you suck,1,0,0.13201678569782896
what could be more schlocky than the idea of private detectives getting involved with the women they re supposed to be spying on  and most of the dialogue as written is perfectly banal but the actors turn the dialog into something that makes sense  you can see real people behind the unreal lines  and the directing is wonderful  each scene does just what it has to and ends without dragging on too long i showed this to several friends in the mid 80s because i was perplexed at how such bad material could be made into such a good movie  the friends enjoyed it too,1,0,0.2747876191262891
i just don t understand why this movie is getting beat up in here  jeez  it is mindless  it isn t polished and it is  as i am reading  wasted on some  the cast of this movie plays their characters to the  t   if you watched permanent midnight and became a ben stiller fan then yes you will be disappointed   these are misunderstood  well intentioned misfits trying to save the city world with nothing but grit and determination  the problem is they don t realize their limits until the big showdown and that s the point  this is 3 times the movie that the spy who shagged me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group  likely the same people who feel the first ap movie pales in comparison to the sequel  i just don t get it  the jokes work on more then one level  if you didn t get it i know what level you re at,1,0,0.17783062019548854
this movie grabbed me with the incredible opening sequence which tricked me into a complete reversal of perspective  so i was hooked by the time the title came on  the theme of this movie is that everyone is acting  trying to re invent themselves  but not_in a tricky way like identity or the usual suspects  but in the way we all try to make whatever banal life we find ourselves in a little more interesting  the scenes in the chicken warehouses are spectacular  at one point jorgen  who owns the chicken farm  attends a seminar in laughing  where he s the worst student  his discomfort at this lets you see the depth of his yearning to change himself  the movie made me wonder about the hidden mysteries that lie behind the surface of the most commonplace people i see every day  there s not_a lot of plot here  guessing the old man s secret is pretty easy  but the fascination lies in trying to guess what all the other characters will do when they figure it out  this movie appealed to me in the same way that sideways did  although the characters couldn t be more dissimilar,1,0,0.21737275009247203
life pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not_to analyze too hard  the acting is rather amateurish  at best  the special effects are obviously low budget  but not_too bad  the story line is rather stock  but with an interesting twist  computer run amok  but not_a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed  still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable  for me  at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of kristine debell  she may not_be the greatest actress in the world  but having been a former playmate of the month  she is cute enough  in all life pod is much like other low budget sci fi movies of the 1980s and somewhat predictable the white star lines bit is cute  if completely inaccurate  the last of the white star lines company stock was purchased by the cunard lines 1947 and the last ship to sail under the white star colors was the britannic  not_the sister of titanic  which was sold for scrap in 1960,1,0,0.25740327054020457
